Fractured
The **CRACK** that resounds through the cave as you finally manage to fracture the Kaleido’s encrusted shell more closely resembles the beginning of a cave-in than the simple breaking of a mollusk’s shell. While she doesn’t have the means to scream, she makes her displeasure more than known as her thrashing shakes the entire cavern. 
For a moment she seems to be shedding her outermost layer but as the floors finally settle back to stationary you can see it’s actually a small swarm of urnlettes crawling over their mother before jumping to the floor to join the fray. Silky remarks, “Who knew that urns carry their young within them! Never the matter, you’ve got her on the back foot now, Rovers! See it through!”
