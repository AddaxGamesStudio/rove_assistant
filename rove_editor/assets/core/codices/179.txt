One Down, Two To Go
The imaginary crowd goes wild as you secure your first victory. Petals from exotic flowers and color-changing confetti rain down as the tournament board is quickly rewritten to display your advancement. From the central observation booth steps a towering keb rasska, the Thought Caser creating the illusion for you, though they seem at least three times as large as in reality. 
The Thought Caser spreads their arms as the keb transmits a feeling of exultation. An unusual quirk, perhaps benefit, of the dream space is that all of you get the full experience of Keb Rasska thought communication, though your physical forms might lack the necessary organs for such experiences normally. Regardless, you arenâ€™t given long to revel in victory before the god-rays filtering from the sky suddenly shift to transmit the bright white light of midday, and the mists once again form into vortices. It seems wave two is to begin immediately.
