Dream Within A Dream
Across the waters is the Yanshif woman, still reeling at anything that comes near. She staggers from limb to limb, the weight of her many wings pressing her downward into the muck. She screams and howls at the sky.
**“TELL ME IF I’M THE ONLY ONE!**
**WAKE ME FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!”**
Mo snaps to attention as the woman finishes her outcry. “Resonance! I see, I see, I see!” they blurt out suddenly. Silky hops forward and begins battering the starling with questions and jargon. It takes on a surprisingly heated tone, with Mo angrily and simultaneously pointing back towards the village, at the coffer containing the recovered relics, and at the jagged boulders of solidified Morph ether breaching the water as they continue the argument.
After a few minutes of further debate, Silky scoffs but doesn’t immediately work to discredit the starling’s arguments. He lilts from one talon to the other, blissfully free of being subjected to the physical torture even just standing in this marsh is generating. After muttering to himself quietly for either minutes or hours, time has lost meaning in this dreadful place, he slowly turns to Mo and chuckles. “Would that I had a score of more like you to help test the finer points of etheric manipulation. The foundation of your hypothesis is… underdeveloped… I am rather certain it masks an ulterior motive, but if the Rovers think the risk is reasonable, we can try things your way.”
Mo’s posture betrays their satisfaction but the starling turns to face you as if remembering to ask permission. When you give no sign of dissent, they launch into a condensed explanation of their theory. Based on the behavior and sensations coming from the tihfur woman, the clan has likely performed a ritual that “shares” their Morphic affinity between prominent members. Using the implements you discovered in the village, a release of the ether can be triggered into separate receivers—the large masses of Dim deeper into the marsh are plausible targets.
