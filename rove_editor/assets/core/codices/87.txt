Unknown Nourishment
Bulwauros are a valuable addition to our stables, for sure. Give them something tall to preside over, a steady supply of water, and they’ll let you drag them pretty much anywhere! Their shell is practically as hard as a keb’s so they’ll shrug off a lot of punishment from things trying to attack the livestock in the night. 
We find them drifting out of the Thunder Mesa with some frequency. Despite thriving in drier places they seem uncontrollably skittish of the thunderstorms. Likely to do with how the metal in their shells attracts the lightning and their inability to regrow a damaged shell. If you’re not trying to rear them, you can just dig a trench and they’ll follow any moving water until it stops! They don’t tend to pick fights unless it’s for the sake of protecting what they consider their source of meals.
