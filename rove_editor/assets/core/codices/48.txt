Between Its Glistening Teeth
In the distant past, stomaw were a proper therian of… some variety, before the Unsouled Barrens chewed them up and spat out whatever savage amalgamation of meat, tooth, and claw they now are. Or, perhaps more accurately, before the stomaw chewed each other up. 
Few beasts are fool enough to make themselves prey for the whirlwinds of bone and death spread across the Barrens, and so the heinous creatures most frequently resort to cannibalism. Given that stomaw seem to be wrought by the region itself–strange and inexplicable hatcheries that form and gestate on their own–it might be something of a wider ecological balancing act conspired by the Barrens. 
Filth within, filth without, as it were.
