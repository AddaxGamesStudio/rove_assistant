To The Deep
Digging through the soil reveals a partially-buried box; its color and texture extremely timeworn. Cracking the lid reveals a singular massive quill with a sharp tip cushioned in a bed of twine and leather. It radiates with an energy not unlike the distressed emotions circulating through the twisted members of the Yanshif clan.
After seeing the scarified woman before, Makaal recounts how many tihfur clans practiced infusing ether into tattoos for both ceremonial and protective purposes. One of his own tattoos comes from such a “patterning”. This quill was likely an implement used in the practice and as such could be valuable.
