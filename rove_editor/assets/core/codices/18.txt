Creeping Darkness
The twisted tihfur clutches at its body—black ichor oozing from its wounds. Confusion spreads over its face, beginning at the rapid movements of its third eye, and twitching down every other feature on its head. Its beak opens and closes as if searching for words, but none are found; instead a stream of ichor pours forth. 
It twists in on itself and falls to the ground—splashing into its own puddle of filth. “Rest now, brother. The flock is less without you,” the tihfur woman plucks a feather from her wing and drops it over his head. A vague hissing reveals that the very blood of the monstrous tihfur you have slain has taken on a corrosive property. Everywhere the fluids touch leaves behind an odd crackling sound as decay sets in. Your attention is pulled away as another voice, one full of phlegm, begins crying out from the forest’s depths.
**“BIRDS OF A FEATHER! BIRDS OF A FEATHER!”**
Another similarly disturbed voice joins in with the crowing.
**“AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN—”**
The tihfur woman drags one of her shifted legs through the dirt, leaving behind deep grooves from the length of her talons. Most tihfur out of shift are lithe, but a better description for the woman whose fight you have joined would be ‘gaunt’. Her entire left side, from head to foot, is covered in an elaborate runic scrawl. Black lettering stretches across her shifted left wing. She allows everyone to inspect her for a few moments before offering a slight bow, causing another feather to fall loose and join the small piles strewn in the grass. She introduces herself as Zeepurah, and sadly emphasizes being the “lone” leader of the Yanshif clan. Before she can explain further, more screeching breaks through the trees.
**“ANOTHER. ANOTHER! MORE. MORE! GATHER. GATHER!”**
Zeepurah’s features darken—a troubling scowl spilling over her face.
