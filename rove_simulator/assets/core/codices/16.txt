Silvan Theory
*Days prior, as the party breaches the outer edge of the forest.*
Mo inspects the sheaf of wood once more while carefully tracing over the engravings with their tendrils. “Relax, Mo. This is simple work for you now!” Makaal encourages. Silky’s aerios whistles in admiration as he inspects the wooden plate. Set into the center of the engravings is a bevel that contains a small chunk of crystallized Earth. 
“I can see that the engravings are meant to direct a catalytic process from the ether, but to what end?” he inquires.
Mo twists their attention to the aerios in surprise. “Is this something that you’ve seen before?” they ask, tilting their head. “To answer your question, it’s designed to capture some of the properties of a grovetender, relying on the Earth crystal to keep part of it alive on the shield. I’ve never tested this design on an Earth-aspected silvan specifically, but I’m confident it will result in a sturdy buckler in the end. Unfortunately, we’ll need to wait until we find quite a strong specimen for the framework to properly attach to.”
