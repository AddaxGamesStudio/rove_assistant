Hope Has Flown Away
**“S T O P  H I M,**
**N O  M O R E.”**
The monster in front of you is barely recognizable as tihfur at this point. Her form has bloated to grotesque proportions, her face a bleached mess of feather and bone, her talons spiral out from the edges of her phalanges only to curve back and bore through her own limbs in multiple places. A half dozen wings along her back cast a haze of ragged pinions with each flap.
**“T H I S  M U S T  E N D,**
**C L I P  O U R  W I N G S.”**
Every blow to the woman is met with a spray of ichor and putrid-smelling fluid. Her body works endlessly to regrow every fracture, laceration, or contusion she suffers. Each time the wound is sealed over with more distorted stretches of flesh and feather. When her body can no longer stitch flesh it begins to protrude naked bone, for lack of anything else to draw upon.
**“E N D  H I S  D I R G E,**
**A M  I  T H E  W I N D E R?”**
Your foe’s movements draw to a weary stillness. Her hulking frame sways in the fetid waters. She tries to take another step towards you, only to find the muscles in her legs have been petrified by her body’s unrelenting convalescence. One of her wings has bifurcated completely, seeping an even darker fluid than the brackish waters of the marsh. A final bid of desperation drives her to cleave her own limbs apart with her massive beak. As she severs the branded limbs of her left side the injuries finally overtake her Morphic healing. She topples over with an immense splash of tainted water. The weakening of her pained squawking signals her eventual demise.
