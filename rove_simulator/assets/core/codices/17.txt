The Airs That Brood
You haven’t even finished wiping the pond scum off before an echoing screech pierces the treeline. It is unlike anything you have ever heard.
When the noise subsides, a person slowly drags themselves out of the trees, the bark creaking and cracking around them. It looks to be a tihfur of the Yanshif, but something is wrong… Their features are distorted and pitch-colored. It gazes toward your party, prompting everyone to move back defensively. Its face, half-formed into a beak, peels back into a crazed grin.
**“GIVE ME YOUR HIDE.**
**GIVE ME YOUR FLESH.**
**GIVE ME YOUR WING.**
**CAN THERE BE ANOTHER ONE?”**
With one more body-rattling screech the menacing tihfur disappears back into the treeline, leaving a trail of dark, sticky ichor. The forest falls deathly quiet except for the gurgling sounds of the strange fluid staining the ground and trees. Even from a distance it emits a presence of sorts; a tangible discomfort and need to repel even the space around it. Identifiably Morphic, but not in the ways that any of you have come to understand. When Morph is expressed it normally comes with a purer sort of desire: to grow, to host, to build. Whatever this is, it is not simply condensed Morph, but something… bitter. 
Grandpaw passes slowly around the substance, keeping a wide berth. Makaal seems lost in thought. Even Mo’s tendrils try to pull themselves away from the grime, completely unbidden. The aerios hops down from its perch to inspect the substance by dipping a small portion of a wing into the gurgling muck. In the blink of an eye he wrenches back just as the tip makes contact; a streak of black energy had burrowed its way through much of the wing from the brief touch. “That, ostensibly masked, plea of the Yanshif messenger may have been even more desperate than we suspected,” Silky intones.
