Dipped in Folly
Nektari are well-known for being a nuisance when allowed to populate in mass. Their main concerns extend to gathering pollen from silvans and defending their hives from intrusion. Their bodies and hives are tempered by the volatile mixtures of ether they harvest and render into a potent slurry to feed their young. This is also theorized to be the source of their vibrancy and can extend to the smaller flora that benefit from their brooding.
That mixture of ether is dangerous in massive quantities, which is why clans work to keep their populations in check, to allow the ether to harmlessly disperse into the environment at smaller scales. These ebony nektari seem to have somehow collected pure Morph ether rather than the typical eclectic mixture of arcane ether. Morph is inherently chaotic and the mixture wrought from this deviant variety is likely dangerous even in small amounts.
