How the Guilty Speak
**FEAR**
You truly seek to condemn Chorus to its fate? **WHY?!** You would follow Chorus to its end? **WHY?!** Everyone of us that lives upon Chorus is bound in fear! **WHY?!** 
The Sovereign’s hysteria is silenced in an instant under the body-shaking sound of crystal grinding against crystal. A lapse of control, a seizure, an unintentional spasm—whatever the cause, the pure white keb just met her end much the same way her sister did, with a near-thoughtless movement of an immense claw. Her death is felt immediately as the leviathan trembles violently and begins to lose altitude.
It seems you were on a southward flight, as the svaraka is now careening towards the forest which was home to one of your first major trials. Each of you braces as the creature’s descent inevitably accelerates, the winds battering around you once more. Having been flung from the creature, Silky’s aerios plunges alongside you in a tailspin.
The crash isn’t as debilitating as expected.  With the leviathan’s immense proportions, the fall is cushioned by its jagged shell reaching the trees and soft ground before its actual body—as much as one can claim a veritable mountain can serve as a cushion in a freefall from the skies. Better still is the wave of soil churned by the impact helping to soften your landing as you are catapulted from the creature.
Eventually you are all roused by the sound of grinding rock and wood—along with the worried calls of your glowing minder. “Good, good. Quite the trip! I do believe we now find ourselves somewhere beneath the Taharik. We need to fell the svaraka before it can drag the forest into yet another calamity. No rest for the weary, eh?” he lets out a weary chuckle.
Indeed, even in its damaged state, the simple writhing of the titan sunders trees and is creating an even deeper furrow where you now stand. It seems that the crash also loosed some of the young it was carrying, each capable of destroying great swathes of the surface on their own.
