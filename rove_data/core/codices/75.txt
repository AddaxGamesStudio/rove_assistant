The Fearless Flight
Streak, named by Air-aspected starlings that found themselves regularly harassed on their journeys through the skies, more than lives up to their name. A predatory avian whose entire body has been honed for a singular purpose–building up as much speed as possible and streaking down at, and sometimes through, their prey. Streak lack the endurance for drawn-out conflict and instead rely upon their affinity for Air ether to gain the upper hand in one or two quick exchanges. Entomans (such as the prevalent galeaper) are their preferred targets as both the beak and talon of the streak can fracture their shells with relative ease once they’ve pierced through.
Unusual, then, for these galeaper and streak scattered before you to not be embroiled in a territorial dispute. This isn’t the first time you’ve seen galeaper coordinating with something above or below them on the food chain; perhaps there is a greater force at play?
