Letting Them Devour
*Sometime shortly after Mo began their travel with Makaal–*
“Mo, why is it that we don’t just keep an urn for ourselves and harvest the lyst that way?” Makaal asks. 
“Because, silly salesmonger, it would consume everything.” Mo replies. 
“Yes, but isn’t that the point? It turns trash into treasure!” Makaal says. 
“Makaal, it consumes everything. It cannot be caged, cannot be calmed, cannot be commanded. It will eat its way out of its prison, then eat its imprisoner, or worse yet simply eat the hand that it would feed from. Above all, the amount of lyst we could get even if we did successfully tame one is… useless. An entire tree for a grain the size of a speck of sand. No, best not to suffer them to continue eating away at Chorus, fascinating as they are.”
