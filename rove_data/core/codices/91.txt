Sleep-Walkers, Not Evildoers
As the last of the controllers and their guards fall, a member of the once-controlled underlings scampers up to you with two limbs raised in surrender. The underling is not accustomed to common speech, but Mo’s early life as a clan alchemist means translation of the various signs and vocalizations of the keb rasska languages comes easy. In rushed and exasperated motions, the keb rasska eagerly explains as much as they can, responding to Silky’s translated inquiries and Mo’s general questioning.
The Ezmen clan is more of a grand army that moves from one subterranean network to another, press ganging any smaller keb rasska clans along their path into service. Fighters serve directly beneath the queens, crafters and alchemists are worked to supply the army, and the entire process is a psychological sieve as the queens identify those who will become the most loyal. Those who are not keb rasska are executed. Those who decline service are executed. Those who try to escape are executed.
Normally each march takes them to a system where they might find the remnants of skara hives. It’s apparently rare to encounter a still-living specimen for a variety of reasons. After the queens heard rumors of a living hive in this particular mountain range, the entire clan was immediately mobilized in pursuit of it. That day also marked when the queens began to behave especially erratically. Where before life in the clan could be described as “safe, however difficult,” these days it seems only to be “creeping amidst eggshells” before the army finds some reason to grind you under heel.
