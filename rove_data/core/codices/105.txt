Coveted Her And Me
After you put to rest the last screeching member of this chaotic exhibition, the frantic woman pulls herself up to gawk at you and the carnage spread throughout the scene. She pants and salivates, working her mouth in various attempts to speak. After a moment of awkward croaking and gagging, she simply shakes her head and launches herself into the shade of the trees beyond the grove, escaping deeper in the forest.
Makaal whispers a quiet command to his companion. Grandpaw slowly lumbers up and presses his snout into the roots of the tree you first saw the woman against, snorting loudly and working to capture her scent for pursuit. Shortly after, the arkenyn rears his head back and bellows out a sneeze, casting a small plume of black spores into the air around the tree. Makaal pulls out a bit of cloth and begins carefully wiping around Grandpaw’s nose and mouth, speaking hushed encouragement.
Mo tilts their head and lashes out a few tendrils against the air. “There’s something further. The ether… feels.”
