Control Me Without Pause
**CONFUSION**
**ANXIETY**
**RAGE**
Why must every last mote of dust fling itself into my path? **STOP FIGHTING!** You call yourself intelligent beings, and yet every last one of you fails to see the greater whole. Look! Just look! **STOP FIGHTING!** Here we find ourselves leagues above Lalos, all-seeing, all-powerful. All you have to do is **STOP FIGHTING!** With one great embrace we can bring peace to all!
Wind and clouds are torn by the leviathan’s jagged exterior. Your footing grows more precarious as moisture, motion, and misgivings threaten your balance. Silky does his best to stay in formation with you, perching on different vantages as he works to ensure your psychic wardstones remain functional. While the pressure against your minds and bodies remains heavy, the Sovereign is unable to affect you directly. She glares at you from her perch with an expression of pure hatred.
While your focus remains largely on the battle at hand, one can’t help but to be at least a little awed by the fantastic sights of Lalos from this high above. Everything can be seen. The northern mountains from where Silky assembled you, the glowing surroundings of Uzem’s Throne, the pitch wastes of the Unsouled Barrens, and surprisingly even the floating archipelago of Era has drifted into view.
The Sovereign cannot be allowed to suppress it all under her grip.
