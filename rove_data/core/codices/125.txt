A Horror They Outpour
Tendrils fill the sky as the broken vessels cast themselves out of the forest. The fierce, predatory gleam in the monster’s eyes starts to fade, replaced with a hollow and vacant stare. The creature’s wings falter, their heavy flapping becoming weak and erratic. A violent deluge of swamp fluids and gasses wash out one last time as the hulking frame of the tihfur monstrosity collapses forward. 
The reaction of the Yanshif scurrying at the edges of the swamp is immediate. Some succumb to sickness, others flee in terror, a few simply stop in place as their eyes gloss over. As the swamp grows quieter, the blanket of miasma seeping to everything begins to slowly, but surely, dissipate, following the trail left by the scattering pseudo-starlings.
Silky’s glistening form is a reprieve from the incessant dank and murk. He takes a few moments to survey the entirety of the swamp from various angles. “I fear to imagine what the outcome of today would have been had we been even one day later in our arrival. I feel I must take some measure of blame; I was aware of a potential threat here in the Taharik, I just didn’t realize it… would spiral so aggressively.”
Your ability to work together to take down greater foes has continued to prove an invaluable boon. The monster lying broken and battered before you wrought havoc on its home by forcing everything within reach to bend to its will. That arrogance and greed will never serve to protect Chorus.
