A Clamorous Appealing
**“H A S A Y O N,**
**Y O U  F O O L!”**
Fetid waters settle and the larger, monstrous tihfur lays still. Its menacing eyes dim and eventually their hateful glow extinguishes entirely. The massive wings, wielded as icons of dread and power, now lay broken and splayed awkwardly—their grandeur marred with countless injuries from the battle. Its swollen body is sprawled out in a disgusting heap.
The change in the environment is immediate. While the miasma is still thick and cloying, it slowly begins to disperse, giving you the opportunity to finally see clearly. This extends to the tihfur woman, whose mania rapidly subsides as she slowly pokes and prods at the dead monster.
**“F O R G I V E N E S S  A S K E D,**
**W E  D I D  N O T  K N O W,**
**m y  f l o c k . . .”**
Her demeanor succumbs to grief and despair. The transformation gripping her body seems to be receding slightly but her form is still abnormal and clearly brings her pain. She groans and begins to sob, her piteous wails echoing throughout the swamp and forest beyond. You give her the time and space she needs now that she’s abandoned her violent frenzy.
Communicating with her is difficult as her distorted features continue to affect her speech. You learn that she is Zeepurah and the larger tihfur was Hasayon, her fellow clan leader and lifemate. Hasayon was a particularly powerful individual but succumbed to an imbalance of Morph. As lifemates they had bound their ether; his corrupted ether affected them both.
Tenuous is the fate of the remaining Yanshif. Hasayon’s rampant ether suffused everything in the region; without it sustaining their transformed bodies and mind, many may fall victim to sickness or other maladies. The Taharik will certainly find balance in some fashion, but it will be forever scarred by the events that transpired.
