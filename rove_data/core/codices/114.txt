Can Ever Dissever My Soul
Doing his best to serve as a beacon in the dark, Silky swoops through the village in an effort to guide everyone away from the village. “I can’t say I’m especially familiar with the fashion in which tihfur channel their ether, but what you’ve found looks promising!” 
Grandpaw’s heavy galloping can be heard just beyond the moat. As he travels the wider berth around the outside of the village, the rest of you cut through back the way you came to safer grounds. Broken vessels swirl languidly through the canopy of the forest, spasming whenever a tihfur screams, but keeping a healthy distance.
Silky continues leading you on to link back up with the merchants. Grandpaw snorts and swings his saddlebags towards your group, waiting for you to deposit your findings before taking off. Makaal is quietly scanning the forest, squinting fiercely to try and stay vigilant in the gloom. Mo doesn’t seem to notice anything—they are deeply lost in their thoughts.
