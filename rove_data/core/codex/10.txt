And Steal Their Sweets
Nektari are a well-regarded sight throughout Lalos. Keb rasska alchemists value their pollen dearly as both the raw powder and mixed nektar are incredibly versatile catalysts. Nektari gather residue from all kinds of floral and silvan life which can be put to use as a sort of… multipurpose ether substitute. Harvesting their hives is something clans perform regularly, as a nektari colony left to their own devices for too long can produce massive, noxious clouds of choking ether-tinged spores that become dangerous in such large quantities. These sporeclouds are easily carried across the wind and can trouble settlements over rather large distances.
The nektari in this hive mistook a key to one of the merchants’ lockboxes as an article of foodstuffs. Though sticky and coated in miscellaneous residue, it seems no worse for wear. However, the entomans now seem quite annoyed at you having stolen their shiny article of not-food!
