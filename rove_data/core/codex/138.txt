Almost Nobody Dances Sober
Ozendyn shudders as his companion animal, Gargaki, cleans the remaining bits of gore from his upper body. He was filled with profound relief that the zusag querists had decided to join them in this particular struggle to help cleave open a route to the Bonespire. It reminds him of his brighter days in The Wake, working alongside his clan to repel the monsters of the Barrens. A grand battle, followed by a night of reverie and learning as they prepared for the next day’s struggle. For a time it seemed like the clan would have eventually succeeded in their goal of containing the monsters to the Bonespire, but… time is rarely so kind.
He hopes whatever they wanted to glean from reviewing the Quire will be satisfactory. Perhaps it would even inspire them to join with his cause in full. Until then, Silky had offered his Rovers for the tasks ahead and Ozendyn would sooner cut off his own limbs than decline such powerful allies.
