One Black Tower
The amorphous coil of tendrils, eyes, flesh and bone expands in shock–gesticulating desperately. As one, every surface in Navel pulses; one heartbeat, two heartbeats. With a final shudder, everything sags, no longer swollen in defiance to a world that wished to see it exterminated.
Bazhar’s flesh sloughed free of his starling core, melting into a pool that bled out across the amphitheater. Unlike any starling core ever recorded, Bazhar’s was both enormous and… wretched. Mottled and pocked across all of its facets, parts of it bubbled as if it were liquid, others torn in a way something solid should not have been able to. The massive core began to vibrate, then in a blur of motion shot itself downward to embed itself within the slowly shrinking Bonespire.
Makaal twists his head back and forth in a panic. “Mo, bag it all now and we can sort the mess later! Ozendyn, it has been an honor to witness your battle alongside the Rovers, but I fear we must escape quickly!”
At last Makaal spots what he was searching for. With practiced ease he collects everyone atop the arkenyn, then turns towards one of the ivory flanges at the edge of the tower. “Hold on!” he shouts, and urges Grandpaw into a charge. As the arkenyn collides with a bone-shaking crash, the ivory breaks free of its connection to the Bonespire and begins to careen toward the ground.
Hanging on for dear life, Grandpaw scrambles along the massive bone and gallops down its length, leaping off at the last moment and landing on the ground with a heavy slam. He lets out a low whine and continues his bounding across the plateau as the full weight of the Bonespire finally begins to collapse upon itself.
