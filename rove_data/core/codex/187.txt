Hey There Big Guy
As soon as it is safe to do so, Mo jogs over to the Earth starling, “Might we have your name, friend?” In response they hold out a branch, or, rather, an arm. A thin vine, the bright green of fresh growth, snakes out from the end of the arm tangling itself into a mess in the air. Mo starts to ask again as the vine twitches, the tangled mess soon resolving itself into perfectly legible script spelling “Hra.” 
Mo grins up at your new acquaintance, “Pleasure to meet you, Hra! I’m sorry you were attacked by those Star Hunters; we’re actually just on our way to confront them more directly. What brings you out to these parts, friend?” 
Hra spells out his answer one word at a time, “Looking for a nice place to take root, preferably by a stream. I must continue now, but thank you for saving me.” With that the starling lifts a leg and holds it out to Mo who, confused, extends their hands. Some of the roots of Hra’s leg retract, loosing a stone into Mo’s hand as well as a short stream of lyst. 
By the time Mo processes the events to look back up Hra is already halfway to the next hill, waving an enormous hand in parting. “I feel partly that we should go after him to make sure the rest of the road is safe,” Mo starts, walking over to hand the pile of lyst to you all, “but to be honest, his ether was giving me quite the migraine. I’m sure he’ll be fine.”
