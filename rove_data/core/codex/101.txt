All The Night Tide
With a series of groans and ear-splitting cracks, the putrid grovetender collapses into a mound of its own filth. A vile substance seeps from the breaks in its bark, hissing and bubbling as it flows out over the ground and into the soil. Scores of dark nektari burst from its branches, revealing an even more barren and desolate form than previously realized. The smaller dekaha spread throughout the grove immediately wither and shrink in on themselves—they were drawing their nutrients directly from the great silvan.
Mo loiters much longer than usual, their tendrils a wild show of movement as they are completely lost in thought. “Patterns… sharing… application…” and other such terms are given a faint voice by the starling. “If there was a method for redirecting the Morph…” they trail off again. Silky perches on their shoulder as they continue to muse quietly. Makaal and Grandpaw move to usher the starling onward just a bit faster.
