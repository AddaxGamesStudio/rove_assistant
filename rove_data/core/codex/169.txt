Loyal To The End
“Get down!” Silky’s aerios cries out across the battlefield. You drop to the ground almost too late as a howling Andiron lunges back into action, dual heads snapping right where your neck was just a moment ago. The beastly companion being back in the fight exacerbates just how hopeless the situation feels. No matter the attack, no matter the strategy, Eclipse never even seems effected, as though the damage never actually reaches him.
“Take heart, Rovers!” Silky reassures, anticipating your thoughts. “He would not concern himself with us if he were truly invulnerable!”
Eclipse’s laugh rumbles through the air. “**By all means, neutralize all the ether you like, I have plenty to spare!**” Despite his haughty self-certainty you can’t help but notice that Andiron still favors his left side, that a few of his own embedded cores have gone dim, that seat is beading on his face. The plan is working, however slowly. 
You’ve faced down the enduring emblem of the Storm itself, a seemingly immortal aspect of the world! Compared to that, despite the intimidating appearance, an Eclipse is but a passing dark moment, nothing that Rovers of your caliber can’t handle.
