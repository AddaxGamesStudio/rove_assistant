A New Age Dawns
*A letter from “Silky,” Fundamentalist of the Mist clan to the clan leaders of Lalos.*
*Dear Friends,*
*I trust you have received my previous missives detailing the unparalleled journey and successes of the group of Apex Rovers, now known as the Defenders of the Yanshif, the Liberators of the Ezmen, the Champions of Uzem, the Cleansers of the Unsouled Barrens, etc., etc. Further, I trust that you have not discarded them out of hand as the ramblings of a mad Zusag and have actually read them and taken the time to consider their contents.*
*While I would like to believe my earlier writings to be so persuasive and self-validating that you have already been convinced of my views, I will instead reiterate a point that some may have missed or ignored: the techniques of which I speak, specifically of cultivating a new modus operandi of cooperation between Rovers, have not only proven exceedingly successful at addressing challenges which would ordinarily be far beyond our ability to meet, but that in adopting them and the mindset which they accompany all of these monumental, continent-threatening catastrophes could have been prevented in the first place.*

*In a wide clearing, under the sun, in the Tolkhin:*

“Keenah, my heart, why are you weeding the seedlings alone?”
“If I am to be the Dominant, mother, I must have the strength to work great acts of the clan!”
With a sigh and slight shake of her head, the cervine Tihfur addresses her daughter, “The Dominant’s job is not to live life for the clan, but to help the clan lead a good life from within. Do not forget, the Dominant sets an example for the clan as well! What would you say if your younger brothers determined to retrieve ice from the mountains alone?”
The young doeling laughs, “I would say they are far too young for such a journey and it would be foolish for them to even attempt so alone!” 
With an impish, knowing smile the mother responds, “And yet you seek to mind the entire field yourself, knowing full well you have an entire herd of friends and siblings who could help?”
Keenah abashedly looks at the ground. Her mother puts an arm around her and leads her back to their home. “I’m not trying to reprimand you, heart, but do not think it weakness to ask for help when it is needed; that sort of thinking leads to an unbalanced Haya. Think of it as an opportunity to grow closer to your friends; besides, most people actually enjoy helping! It makes them feel useful.”

*In a rocky crevice, in the shadows in Kifkyos:*

“I told you couldn’t do it! You need to faster!” a young Keb Rasska screeches as they run from their friends to the chaperone of their Sekya game. Embarrassment, Shame, Frustration echo from the keb. The child chitters at the chaperone, “Can we be on other team? Other team faster…” The chaperone keb and rasska look at each other and shake their heads. 
Reassurement, Sympathy, Authority radiate from the chaperone keb. “Do you like other team?” the ask. The rasska child shakes her head. “Do you like friends? Friends on team?” Friendship, Fun, responds the keb girl. “Then play with friends! Teach friends faster, have fun, worry less!” The rasska chaperone guides the pair back to the playing area while the keb intones Understanding, Growth, Contentment. 
After the frustrated children apologize to their friends, the chaperone tosses the grub back into play, watching to see if they actually participate this time. In the first match the children were so busy looking for opportunities to criticize they completely failed to help their team play. Satisfied the children actually trying this match, the chaperones return to their internal conversation about the recent earthquakes nearby. 

*Far to the west, in a small wooden hovel on a hill:*

In a shower of splinters the young casteling raises their tendrils and directs the small cloud of ether into a caged bird. The bird’s wings start to beat against the cage as it caws louder and louder, eventually attracting the young starling’s guardian.
The older castor Zusag enters the room, sees the broken timepiece on the floor and scrambles to gather the pieces with a screech. “No, no, Klo, why did you do this?!” The casteling looks confused at the Zusag’s strong reaction. 
“It was infused with Air, but it wasn’t using it. Ikki has trouble flying with her wing, so I thought the Air would help her.” The Zusag groans before flipping over a large chunk of the decorative cap of the timepiece and letting out a relieved sigh. 
“Oh, stars above, thank goodness the core is intact! Klo! This timepiece was the resting place for my partner Uhr. When they reached the end of their life they asked for their core to be fashioned into a timepiece. Partly to poke fun at my tendency to be late, and partly for their resting place to be something practical, but that’s besides the point.”
The Zusag gently holds the core in front of the starling and places one of the child’s hands on the faceted surface. “Klo, this wasn’t infused as a timepiece, it was infused with the last of Uhr’s ether as a memento. I know you were trying to help Ikki, and I appreciate the thought, but just because something is there doesn’t mean that it’s there for you, understand?” The child nods, suitably chagrined. “You have to remember that sometimes when you break something, you can’t put it back together. Come talk to me when you have an idea like that and I’ll talk it through with you, okay? We can make a plan together.”

*Deep in the desert, in the shadow of a dune:*

“What a strike, Melyn! I never thought we’d get an Armoroll all by ourselves!” A short, cheery human calls to his brother, offering his hands for a celebratory clap that, sadly, doesn’t come. Azjer drops his hands with a “Tsk!” His brother is staring at the Armoroll’s body, stroking the few thin hairs on his chin (as he has started to do ever since they first came in).
“Azjer, what do you think we could get for it if we brought it to the market?” he finally asks, dropping his hand.
The younger brother looks shocked. “I don’t know, more than we’ve ever seen in one place probably. But, Melyn, what a boon it would be for the clan!”
The older brother nods, sizing up the armored plates with his hand. “Sure, but some lyst in our pockets would also serve the clan well. With some new weapons and tools for ourselves, we’d be able to catch bigger prey like this more often.”
Azjer reluctantly grunts in understanding before adding, “Sure, but don’t you think the clan should at least get a say? The meat alone could feed us for weeks; besides, we don’t even know enough to tell whether gear is any good or not!”
Melyn groans, but admits defeat. “Fine, you’re right. The plating can probably already be made into some armor for us, and the meat should help get some of the others back into fighting shape. At least, I really hope so, because I don’t know if you and I could deal with those wrathbones in the canyon on our own, even with the priciest weapons at the bazaar.”

*Let it not slip from your minds that there are still plenty of threats across Lalos that could quite quickly grow to match the challenge of those my Rovers have only just finished managing. All I ask is that you consider it. If you need a demonstration, the victorious Apex are still hard at work and I do not doubt they provide near miraculous proof of these strategies almost daily!*
*As always, I remain at your service. If you have any questions, please respond to my letter poste-haste and I shall endeavor to address you directly (through an ether construct).*
*In peace,*
*Silky, Mist-clan Fundamentalist*

Mo stands before a wrist-thick sapling growing on a windswept hill. Far in the distance, though easily visible to the naked “eye” lies the, only somewhat, shrunken Unsouled Barrens. This land speaks to the starling though, as the retreat of the foul corruption of the Barrens has still left this border area strangely empty as the surrounding silvans, therans, entomans, and just about everything else still seems cautious about extending back into that once-claimed clay.
Everything except this tree, which has boldly claimed this bald hilltop and declared its intentions to make it a home. Ever so gently, Mo places an object right in the cleft of the tree’s first two branches. With careful movements, and a bit of ether coaching, the starling uses the tree’s own twigs to secure the object in place, ensuring that it catches the sunlight just so. 
After a moment, they step back to examine their work. Nu’s core shatters the sunlight into a thousand-thousand colored rays, looking like some sort of mythical fruit grown by this fledgling tree. Satisfied that Nu is sufficiently settled in this peaceful place of new beginnings, Mo spares a final still moment for their sibling before turning to rejoin Makaal and Grandpaw slowly making their way south to explore the southern deserts. 
The rays cast by Nu’s core dapple the ground even as it starts to shiver, then shake, then rumble as far in the distance a fissure begins to split the profane ground of the Unsouled Barrens. But Mo chose well, and Nu and their little sapling will stand unbothered on their little hilltop as Silky’s new age of Lalos faces its first new challenge.
