Don’t Touch my Chains
**DISAPPOINTMENT**
**INDIGNATION**
**FEAR**
Femii’s emotional outbursts continue and send the rest of the soldiers in the corridors to scatter, likely afraid of retribution should they too fail to live up to their queen’s expectations. Grandpaw trods alongside Mo and Makaal, with Silky’s aerios perched upon Mo’s shoulder.
Kelo and Saras lay sprawled across the ground, equipment shattered against the rocks, the debt of loyalty paid in full. Grandpaw sniffs carefully around the bodies. “Some shards of the ezmenite carry significant residual Earth ether to be drawn upon, but otherwise the remaining material is only good as lyst.” Mo explains.
Helpless against Femii’s bidding, the skara has successfully managed to tunnel its way into the deep chamber that the two leaders of the Ezmen clan now hide within. The only choice now is to follow and dethrone the oppressive queens.
