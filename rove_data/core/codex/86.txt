Uzem
Silky dives as quickly as he can, only now realizing that Mo had quietly slipped down into the shrine. To say he wasn’t prepared for what awaited him within would be one of the bigger understatements of his decently-long life. The Rovers are spread out and recuperating from a literal battle against a force of nature. Mo is… communing? The starling’s tendrils are almost touching The King of Storms, slowly undulating as both seem to be concentrating. A sudden twitch of movement has Uzem gazing directly at Silky. Not his conjuration, but himself. It was potent enough to remind him of his physical body—a startling lapse in his concentration.
“Even this great beast finds your talents impressive, Silky!” Mo chuckles. “There’s nothing to worry over. With everything that’s happened, something that I failed to learn in my past has been awoken and imparted properly,” they say, waving around the starling core always held in their tendrils. “I struggle to call this creature conscious, as you or my clan might say, but there is surely… intent. He communicates strongly with impressions carried along his ether. I doubt that you want to keep us here to study it further, but I would suggest keeping the thought.”
Silky shakes away his surprise and properly takes in the scene. A wanton spray of elemental power is etched from end to end of the chamber. He is beginning to worry that even his conjuration might not be able to remain safe from harm should battles become more explosive. Loud braying snatches his attention back to The King of Storms. With a wave of crackling antlers, an arc of lightning is sent shooting off. It arcs its way around the chamber and through each of the Rovers in turn. There is no reaction besides their surprise at the burst of energy and shared looks of confusion.
Mo claps and immediately sprints around the chamber, tools wielded in as many limbs as possible as they collect anything that was viable material from what’s left after the battle. Something of a makeshift maul is held together loosely with straps of vine and hide. Mo presents it to Uzem, and after holding his gaze for a dangerously long moment, another burst of energy is unleashed into the weapon. “He wanted to thank the beings that fought on his behalf, and I couldn’t help but try to see if I could squeeze in my own opportunity.” Mo lilts their head as they twist their attention to the ether-infused weapon, lost in the process of its refinement.
