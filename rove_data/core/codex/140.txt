Inchoate And Rudely Fashioned
As the fighting gives way to settling gore, the screaming becomes distant and hollow. Mo shakily rises to their feet and takes slow, ungainly steps towards the dead human hosting the broken vessel cores. They kneel down and let their tendrils reach closer to the exposed chunks of the cores. “The closer we get to the tower, the more… something is happening to the Morph. It’s not easy to describe, but I don’t think this is going to turn out the way the Star Hunters are hoping it will.”
Ozendyn nods and thinks back to how his clan usually handled encounters with the vessels. “The monsters are always drawn to one another. We usually either completely shatter the core or launch them for stomaws to drag back deeper into the Barrens. It never once occurred to us to try and draw ether from them, but perhaps at one point somebody discovered why.”
