Birds of a Feather
There are many beasts across Lalos that escape the attention of some clans. Streaks are a good example. Fierce, airborne predators that snatch their prey so quickly that you might not even notice when one has attacked! They probably had a few different names when clans were more spread out than they are now. Starlings that fly across the winds alongside them helped us realize we were all talking about the same thing and gave us their own name for them.
Since then, theyâ€™ve become a highly desirable companion to rear. Trained for different things but all valued for the same reason: their fearsome speed. Imagine a knife being thrown at you by the strongest fighter you can think of; now imagine it traveled twice as fast and could think for itself. Whether for hunting, carrying messages, or even an extra hand in battle the utility is obvious.
