Trained Killer
In the cavern base of the Star Hunters the only natural light filters in through a small hole in the roof, about the length of a person. Even that is blocked currently, as Eclipse dangles from the ceiling carefully attaching and aligning ether crystals.
“Those thrice-cursed Rovers are getting in the Chief’s way,” the courslayer captain hisses. “We are to capture one of their companions to draw them away from the Chief’s work. Playing to our strengths, yes, but do not think this a simple task; these Rovers are strong, we likely will not all survive. But, we only need buy time for a day or two. Then, it will be too late for them anyway!”
The courslayers call their companions from the shadows and feed them wogberries to strengthen their venom. Time for a new hunt to begin.
