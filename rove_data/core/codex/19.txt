Unnatural Stillness
A blood-chilling shriek floods the forest, drowning all other noise. Crashes as if entire tree trunks were being cleaved follow after the clamor. Large talons erupt from the treeline and snap through a wide trunk—a mature and hulkling tihfur, in full shift, emerges from within the forest. 
**“EEENOUGH!”**
That single word is enough to send every other creature scattering back into the forest. It lets out a deafening shrieking roar before springing into the sky and flying into the murky dusk—its heavy wingbeats disturbing the forest in its wake. “I certainly think not! I’ll be the judge of whether we’ve had enough!” Silky’s aerios squawks before taking off after it in a flurry of glimmering wingbeats. 
“Skin me alive! That’s the direction of my flock’s roost. Forgiveness asked, Rovers, but I need your help for more than was prescribed. They will poison the bodies and spirits of my remaining family—this cannot be allowed.” 
Triumphant baying from Grandpaw heralds his emergence from the trees with Mo and Makaal in tow on his back. Makaal grins and extends both hands to help you on. “We’ll meet you there!”
Zeepurah nods and takes off skyward. Her other wing bursts forth in an eruption of ragged feathers—each flap casting off wads of frayed pinions that further darken the treetops beneath her.
