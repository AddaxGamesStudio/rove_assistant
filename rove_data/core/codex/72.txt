Whisperer in Darkness
It was time for one final journey. Ozendyn appeared especially battered and weary, but he hoped the human could join him. This time he would incorporate his hopeless children and see through their nightmares for himself. Each core of Morph a repository of every fear, every anger, every pain that all of his offspring had produced. Bazhar would take all of this and live the rest of his life as they had–disembodied, frightened, no hope for the future. 
Bazhar stilled. Bazhar withdrew two arms, one tail, three torsos, four legs. Bazhar no longer wished to see. Bazhar’s tendrils were the chains that bound him to the world. Bazhar’s ether was the ash that suffocated his home. Bazhar receded. Bazhar no longer wished to feel. Bazhar was the dying heart of Lalos.
