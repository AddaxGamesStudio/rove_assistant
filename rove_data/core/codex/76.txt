Perfectly Heartless
*Transcribed teachings from “Dun,” a Starling scholar.*
Urn. A word used to refer to storing the deceased. They used to have many names, but starlings revealed our reverence for these creatures and shared our name for them with the others. This was acknowledged and respected, for it is rare that starlings apply our vision to the world this way.
The corpse of a starling is a crystal. The body of our energy. Energy and memory and identity and legacy. Urns remind us of this. They adapt to the world as we do. They create their bodies from it as we do. They become part of the world as we do. They leave behind crystals when they die as we do.
The difference? They are just energy. There is no identity. There is no legacy. There is no memory. Greed; consuming that which they do not even need to survive.
