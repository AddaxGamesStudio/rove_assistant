A Sunless Garden
Silky gazed upon the darkening sky through his projected vision. The rain and wind were gathering in fervor. Erratic patterns were emerging in the distant flight of the streaks around the addax’s shrine. Uzem’s condition was clearly growing worse, and he suspected the crown the party just defeated was a contributing factor.
That mass of Crux ether was surely a slice of the addax’s power. Conceit was followed by confusion about how Uzem could manifest power directly over such a massive distance from himself. Conjuring storms was one thing, mostly an application of elemental ether that propagated on its own. Overpowering the energies of an individual entity with one’s pure essence in such a manner as just witnessed was… inconceivable. Was it because the crown was Uzem’s progeny? The development of a crown to an addax was poorly understood; was this part of that process? Or was it merely an accident?
Too many questions.
