A Strange Spirit Stalks
Starlings are… beings of potential before anything else. That is why the nascent formations are referred to as ‘vessels’ and ‘sprites’–they are unrefined forms simply waiting for their opportunity to develop. That assumes a natural genesis. 
We know now that the starlings formed within and around the Unsouled Barrens are, at least seemingly, quite unnatural. Other starlings refer to them as “broken” for reasons only they seem to fully comprehend and the end result is a shocking lack of pity on their part for these lost souls.
Broken Vessels are exceedingly eager to merge their essence with anything sentient they come across. This manifests quite violently and is unwelcome by all, including other creatures akin to themselves. Perhaps they’re acting on a twisted version of the base starling instinct to seek ether?
