Grains Of Golden Sand
It is equal parts surprising and not to see the likes of a haunt amidst the ruins. The small therans are notorious for rooting around in forgotten reaches of clan settlements and stuffing whatever catches their eye into their hidebound pouches. Particularly ravenous ones will even attack starlings to try and harvest their cores—for some reason they don’t perceive the rest of the being surrounding it. 
“How” they managed to reach the heart of the Taharik isn’t so confusing—their affinity for Crux gives them a natural resistance to the effects of the Morph pall surrounding the forest and helps bolster their nascent ability to trick the eyes and ears of would-be predators. Even the broken vessels seem unwilling to pay them attention for longer than a moment.
“Why” they would already know to be here is a lingering question. Worse still is that this one managed to get its hands on a zusag relic—something that should have been well-guarded or otherwise very difficult to both locate and snatch for the furry little annoyance.
