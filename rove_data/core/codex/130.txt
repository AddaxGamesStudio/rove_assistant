The Thing That Is Hidden
Silky regards the haunt with a mix of exasperation and begrudging admiration. To him the creatures are persistent irritants. Small, furry embodiments of mischief that rival even the youngest of associates. Anything that sparkles or shines becomes the object of obsession; the nuisances stop at nothing to make their own. A shame they aren’t easy to domesticate—they could make for excellent teaching aids with their innate mastery over using Crux ether to avoid detection.
This one has managed to pilfer a construct matrix from an unknown zusag cache. Silky knows he needs to figure out how a simple theran could outwit so-called masters of the trade, but that is a far less pressing concern to be tackled during a far less stressful future. For now it is more than good enough that the object is back in the clutches of those who would make use of it.
