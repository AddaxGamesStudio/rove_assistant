Cage Master
With a careful chop to the neck the harrow sends his opponent to the cold mat on the floor. A few others whoop at his skill as he raises a fist in victory. Thin for a Star Hunter, let alone a harrow, his continued advancement confuses some of the newer recruits, but they can’t deny his effectiveness. After basking in success for another few seconds he leans over the courslayer on the ground, only just waking back up. That one, he thinks, the water core in their thigh. In a flash he wrenches the core free, sending an arc of blood through the air. Holding it aloft the room erupts in cheers.
Mo can’t help but to cheer as you slay the warden, their tendrils wrapped around the bars of the cage as they eagerly await your rescue. After you free them, they’ll have to figure out some counter to the Earth infusion; this can never happen to them again.
