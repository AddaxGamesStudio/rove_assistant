Dissemble no More
Mo strains to track the Rovers as they fight their way through the marsh. Sensing ether throughout the Taharik in its current state has been exceedingly difficult—the Morph hangs like a blinding curtain over virtually everything. Having spent enough time focusing on the differences, a surprising fact becomes apparent as the Rovers unleash another swarm of nektari.
The Morph-addled entoman aren’t collecting the ether, they’re dispersing it! The Morph accelerates their growth and allows them to spread quickly, discharging their spores and creating an environment that allows them to generate more and more pockets of charged and polluted miasma that leeches into the rest of the environment.
