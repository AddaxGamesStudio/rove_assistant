Eclipsed
The echoes fade from Eclipse’s voice as he speaks, slowly shrinking back to that of a single human. “**I can’t believe it. By you! You who seem the most vulnerable.**” His breaths come shallow and fast. “I see how you require each other, how you hurt when your companions do. How? How does it not drag you down, deplete you? No…” he trails off and looks over at Andiron’s still form. “No, perhaps it was me. I was vulnerable, even at the end. Can it not be, then? Can no one stand tall enough, gather enough strength, to live, assured of their own peace? Why could I not protect them?”
His head lolls over and his eyes land on Makaal, Grandpaw, and Mo approaching now that the fighting is over. His voice falls to a whisper, “And yet you could.” He looks down at his body, at the shattered and dim cores embedded therein. His tears fall onto the cold stone beneath as draws one last raspy gasp before growing still.
Suddenly, the sky darkens almost to night. A second passes, less, a heartbeat, and then it brightens again. Era, drifting overhead, had passed in front of the sun for a moment.
Mo holds Nu’s core aloft, aligned perfectly with the island flying away towards the horizon. “Be at peace, my sibling, my friend. I’m sorry you couldn’t be here to witness it, but our people have one less worry in the world.” Makaal wraps an arm around their shoulders, pulling them into a tight hug as Grandpaw nudges his wide head against their chest.
Silky’s aerios flutters down in front of you all, unusually solemn as it considers each of you in turn. “I can say, with the utmost honesty and sincerity Rovers, that you have met and exceeded even my wildest expectations— no, my wildest hopes for the success of our little experiment. I’ve never encountered another Rover, either in my own travels nor even in my extensive little library, who could even approach the accomplishments you all have wrought.”
The aerios spread its wings and approaches, awkwardly wrapping its limbs around each of you in a rough approximation of a hug. “I have one final request of you all: when you return to your clans and homes, make sure to spread the knowledge of all that you have learned these past weeks. We stand at the precipice of a new age, Rovers, and you must ensure that the next generation of adventurers to follow you knows what is possible; that they can find friends and compatriots among the Rovers of other clans. You can’t see it through the construct, but I’m shivering in excitement thinking of the future you’ve just won for us all!”
