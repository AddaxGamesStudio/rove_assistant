Monstrous, Unnatural, Colossal
Mo watches with a thrill as the giant monster of spike and bone collapses in on itself, the malicious glow of its ether slowly draining away. Having spent much of their life as far away from the Unsouled Barrens as possible, in and around the northern sea of Lalos, all Mo had to go on was hearsay and rumors that would reach the subterranean commune that shaped the starling. None of what had been described made sense at the time, but being here in person confirmed the wildest of claims the clan purported.
Not everything that had been spoken of was true, or even remotely accurate, but this place had certainly earned its reputation. What is surprising to Mo is that this place had taken on the name of “Barrens”. Frightening and dangerous as the area is, it is also absolutely replete with Anima ether. Morph obviously, but an interesting undercurrent of Crux is present amidst the rocks and soil.
Staying here longer than needed was far from any of Mo’s ideal futures, but there was no reason not to at least take the opportunity to see what could be fashioned from the materials on offer. The Rovers certainly seemed to appreciate the effort and it was exciting to see how they breathed life into the various creations. Hopefully enough of the equipment would prove valuable in pursuit of futures stolen from Mo and other starlings.
