The Only Truth is Longing
Kelo wails and grasps at his stomach, the phantom pain of Saras completely wracking his senses. A wound like that—his sister is going to die, surely. He tears his attention from the minds of his entourage and examines Saras. She wears a fierce grin and wraps her tail around his lower body assuringly. He reaches down and squeezes one of her claws in his. Her once powerful limbs now barely hold his grasp.
Time crawls to a stop. Kelo stills his breath, casting his power across his sister’s body and probing for every injury. Sovereign Femii taught him how to utilize a body beyond its peak, but this was his sister! HIS SISTER! As his thoughts turn to fury his captive support begins to writhe and hiss—their minds filling with his broadcast emotions.
“Use this body, brother… Always there for support. Always…” Saras’s mouth fills with fluid, unable to continue speaking. It’s now or never, and Kelo won’t let the trust of Saras or Sovereign Femii be lost for nothing. He spreads his senses over her body and begins letting his Morph do the work.
First is obscuring pain. That’s simple enough as rasska don’t hold on to pain for very long as their bodies recover so quickly. Next is seizing the nervous system. This is far more delicate work—redirecting every single signal in a body to act against its natural course. There are hundreds of reasons for why this is something a mind handles unconsciously. To take control of it himself and function everything consciously… were it not for the ezmenite surrounding them, Kelo is unsure if he could do it. A small part of his thoughts dedicated to his queen become awash in awe. She is able to do this so easily to so many?! Such power Sovereign Femii wields.
The younger brother whispers a small apology to his sister as he wrenches her somatic processes into his own mind. Her last surface thoughts are cloudy, filled with fear and sadness, but his silhouette stands out clearly. She never once stopped thinking about him.
Kelo screeches in rage. How dare these interlopers ruin their lives. This is exactly what Sovereign Femii’s great work would put an end to. Kelo would make certain.
