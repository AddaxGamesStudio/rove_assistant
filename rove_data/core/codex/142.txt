Blasphemously Surviving Nightmares
Dozens of maws across Bazhar’s form are frozen open in livid rictus. His voice, however, is singular for the first time since any of you have heard him speak. “Decay. Entropy. No matter how frequently the pot is stirred, something is always lost. This dream of mine has died a hundred times over, and yet I still found myself clinging to scraps of hope that I might prove my methods.” The tangle of limbs that make up the ancient starling jerk and spasm. One hand reaches toward a face, only to fall away and splatter against the hard material of the Bonespire. 
“Star… Hunters? Yes, that tastes right. Some of the more powerful of their number came to this tower. Such… greed. It matched my own, in some ways.” Another limb falls away from the dying mass. Ozendyn grits his teeth loudly. One of the eyes dotting Bazhar’s mass rolls in its socket to gaze upon the warrior. “Thank you for performing your duties. I destroyed your family again and again. Your ancestors were some of the only humans to escape my… slaughter. Your new family fell again when the Star Hunters roused me and… fed themselves to Navel.”
More and more of the starling’s corpulent body pours away, streaking down his tower as streams of pure Morph to the ground below. What had been channeled to create flesh was quickly returning to its original state. The entirety of the Barrens slows to the faintest hints of movement across the plateau. Bazhar shifts and another large hunk of him melts away. “Apologizing would be… insincere. My body has always worked to repel invaders, after all.”
Another eye rolls to face the stairs descending back into the guts of the spire. “I sense you hiding, young surge. I feel the Morph of your vessel… not fully washed by the thirst for arcana. I will leave you a part of me so that Navel is not forgotten. Perhaps you may even one day deliver my memories to Era.” One final chuckle bubbles its way out of Bazhar. Then the rest of his form finally sloughs away as a river of sludge streaming its way over the lips of the Bonespire.
For the first time in decades, the entirety of the Unsouled Barrens falls deathly quiet.
