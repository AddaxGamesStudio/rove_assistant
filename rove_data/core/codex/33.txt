Such A Fuss
Onisski are large entomans that stalk the subterranean depths in search of a place to grow their homes. Their only instinct to cultivate the glowing fungus that roots in and shakes free from their carapace. For a variety of reasons the so-called onisski finds itself as the custodian of many such deep and dark places. The phosphorescent mushrooms they cultivate are quick to bloom and rich with Water Ether, which supplies sustenance for other life they share their environments with. Clans that preside deep within Chorus rely upon the trails that onisski develop as a way to create fertile grounds for farming and irrigation.
While the glow from an onisski’s fungal colony may seem welcoming… it marks a kind of danger as well. Not only are the entomans driven into a frenzy when anything approaches their colonies, but the tendrils of these mushrooms can punch through anything when they’re taking root. Soil, rock, carapace, and especially flesh. A natural death for these creatures is when their personal spore colony has literally torn through their own bodies.
