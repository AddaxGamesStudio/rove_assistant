Zydero Reef
Mo had tried to warn you all to watch your footing on the reef’s famous ferrorsands, but nothing could have prepared you to feel your feet being moved out from under you. According to Mo, local beliefs state that the magnetic “currents” of the sands mimic those of the waters in the lagoon nearby. Perhaps, then, the sand pulling you towards the jagged exposed coral nearby mimics the current that beached and stranded the abandoned ship on the shore before you.
The ship’s exterior looks almost new, excusing the few gaping holes gouged out by the metallic corals of the reef. Makaal’s curiosity gets the better of him (again) and he pokes his head in through the largest opening. Just as quickly he withdraws, falling in the tugging sands in his haste to return to you. “It’s like a piece of the Unsouled Barrens in there! Blood and flesh strung across the walls!”
You cautiously approach to investigate. Indeed, looking inside the walls are festooned with semi-dismembered dyads, their flesh pale and beginning to rot. But this was not done as some unusual hunting tactic; some of them bare stichting as though someone attempted to sew them back closed, or in some cases together. You can only guess the bloody lower half of a torso must have once belonged to the deranged butcher.
As you turn to leave a damaged board snaps beneath your feet, the crunch of wood reverberating through the ship. The immediate cries, screams, and roars encourage your swift exit and egress down the beach. The ferrorsands impede your movement, and before you can get out of sight a wretched unholy abomination emerges from the ship, flanked by a cadre of dyads covered in scars and stitches.
The hydra before you hisses at the sunlight before focusing its many, many eyes upon you. Perhaps a dozen dyads all haphazardly assembled together, the many mouths gnashing and drooling as they all struggle to snap closed around your flesh. A small herd of scavenger bulwauros emerge behind it and quickly spread out across the sands. There’s nothing for it, you’ll have to fight your way out of this.
