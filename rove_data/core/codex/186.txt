*“I’m sorry, chief, I failed.” Silky stands before the Tihfur Dominant, head hung in shame, ears and tail unusually still and drained of all mirth. This Silky, whiskers still taught with youth, is experiencing his first ever failure to affect an entire clan, though, sadly, not his last.*
*The Tihfur Dominant bows to Silky, surprising the young Zusag. “Thank you, Querist Silky. You have saved our clan from utter annihilation.” Silky shakes his head in confusion. “But I was wrong! People died!” The Dominant raises his hands, brushing off the Zusag’s words.*
*“Yes, you were wrong as to exactly where the monstrosity would appear, and a few, tragically, lost their lives. But if you had not come to warn us, our entire clan would have been camped right where the sinkhole opened up! Please, just promise me that you won’t let this beast continue to go unchallenged!”*

“At last, I kept my promise, chief,” Silky remarks, wing going to wipe his tears before remembering to disconnect from the construct to do so. “Thank you, Rovers. Not only have you rid the lands of a constant worry and threat, but you have brought me no small peace.” 
Mo holds aloft a section of the Kaleido’s shattered shell saying, “Not to mention the large pieces!” Makaal chuckles but also slaps the starling on the shoulder.
