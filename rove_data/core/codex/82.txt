With Many Tears
You power your way up and over the torrential waterfall onto the wide node of the bough, aided by the grappling hooks Mo made for each of you. At the center of the node sits both the giant crystal of Water ether, as well as the crown embodying Uzemâ€™s aspect. Its fur is damp and matted, almost unrecognizable in comparison to the regal bearing the therans normally hold.
Great streams of fluid pour from its face and antlers, greedily soaked in by the dekaha. The crown staggers and sways, spraying its makeshift tears in a desperate bid to keep you from approaching.
The silvans dotted around the area sway and writhe in motion with the crown. While this progeny of the addax is doomed to its fate one way or another, life will still continue despite the chaos brought about in its wake.
