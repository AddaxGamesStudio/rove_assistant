Into the Tainted Air
An exultant screech echoes through the village, gleeful and gurgling. Strange energy flows through the trees and chokes the air. There is no still water found in a raging river—you have even less time than you previously thought.
Pillars of dusk open through the treetops as dozens of claws tear their way through the leaves. Wingbeats fill the air from all directions as they descend from the trees—hissing Galeaper cleave their way through the village, followed by another imposing Nahoot. The Zaghan scans the remnants of the village, slowly swiveling his head around completely with disturbing crunches punctuating it every few degrees, before spinning back and stopping to lock all three eyes with Zeepurah.
**“HE MISSES YOU. WE NEED YOU. WHY WON’T YOU STAY WITH US?”**
Zeepurah snarls and whips a slab of broken wood with shocking speed at the fallen tihfur, who disappears back into the trees with a hissing screech. “I DID STAY—OUR HOME IS HERE!” she screams in reply.
