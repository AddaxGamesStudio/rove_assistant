Rage Unleashed
With a gasp the Embercaller is defeated, that wicked smile finally slipping from her face. What Star Hunters remain quickly flee, leaving their fallen behind. The crown prances about the hollow triumphantly, ether streaming from the fallen Star Hunters in long wisps forming a cloud around the aspect’s antlers. The crown stands tall, bellowing out its victory call as the ether collapses into its flame-shaped horns. The air suddenly feels lighter, the intense heat rolling off the aspect changes from the air-stealing heat of a wildfire, to the soul-healing warmth of a sunny day.
Sparing you all a bare glance, the crown launches itself out of the hollow to rejoin The King of Storms waiting below. “It’s good, what you did,” Mo comments, waving a tendril at the retreating form. “The aspects are unbalanced on their own, their Crux seeks the whole. This region will fare better the more… symmetrical Uzem is.”
Silky’s aerios appears at the entrance to the hollow. “Indeed! Addax Uzem’s wellbeing will be reflected in the Thunder Mesa for years to come. Your deeds serve a second purpose as well; the aspects are a part of Uzem, meaning that he experiences what they experience. Hopefully this means that as we approach his shrine he remembers us as friends.”
