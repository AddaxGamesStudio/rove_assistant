Your enemies fade to mist as the distraught crowd loudly complains of your loss. There are scattered applause for your efforts, but the overarching response seems to be one of genuine disappointment, and commiseration. At least this battle hasn’t left you with any aches, pains, or actual injuries.
The crowd and mezzanine disperse back to pale mist, though the noise of the crowd still fills the space. Standing between two of the arena’s pillars you see your keb rasska hosts who roll their two heads in the ilk’s version of a shrug. They approach you, their dream form towering over you, and bend down to thank each of you for your efforts and congratulate you on lasting as long as you did.
And then you are looking at the back of your eyelids, the plush of the carpet beneath you molded to your sleeping form.
You open your eyes to see the incense quickly dispersing from the room, your host gathering up the ether twine from around you. They thank each of you again before beginning to return your belongings. “Our burrow will always welcome you, Rovers, and your next attempt when you seek it.”
