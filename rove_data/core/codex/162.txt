Let’s Get You Out Of Here
Half a day’s retreat further north Silky directs the group to a hidden divot in the mountainside as a place to rest and regroup. Without the pressing worry of escape everyone also takes a moment to finally welcome Mo back home, especially Grandpaw who is busy giving the starling an olfactory pat-down, in between gentle licks. Makaal embraces his friend for a long while before jokingly reprimanding Mo for missing work.
In the quiet of the night everyone finds a chance to relax around the campfire, if only for a moment. Mo, sitting at the edge of the camp to be beneath the open sky, is holding Nu while looking at the stars. Makaal has been talking to them about being captured, but also about the ups and downs of the entire journey so far. Just before the human heads to bed Mo remarks, “I think, after all this, it’s about time I find somewhere for Nu to rest. After everything that’s happened, I think I’d rather stay as myself, and let Nu remain who they once were.”
The night passes peacefully. In the morning, however, you awake as the world seems to be coming to an end.
