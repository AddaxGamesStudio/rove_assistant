The Poison Of Life
The silvans that populate Chorus are a wild and varied assemblage of the hyper-specialized. In most of these cases an adaptation towards a particular blend of ether is at play. More specifically, some aspect of the minor arcana has influenced the development of the flora and helped it find a niche within different environments. The dekaha uses pressurized streams of fluid for both defense and offense, the ashemak uses explosive propulsion to spread its seeds far and wideâ€” one could go on.
What separates the azoth is its affinity for not just one of the major anima (which would already be a highly unusual property to ascribe to a silvan) but both Morph and Crux ether. This combination is unheard of in most life on the planet and lends a particular kind of reverence for the strange silvans. Unfortunately, a result of that combination means that the boughs and fruit it rears take on a kind of half-sentience. Its branches twist and snap in mind-bending displays as it tries to pierce any that draw too close. The zokolat that grow from the azoth behave more like a swarm of aggressive entoman than larger-than-average seed pods (as traditional fruit should) scrambling around the tree and trying to gnaw their way through anything softer than their outer shells.
Rarity and lethality of proximity to the azoth has left many with the opinion that its treasures are not worth the pursuit.
