Silky taps a claw loudly against an antler. “Galeaper carapace is very sharp but also quite brittle. They are an entoman species evolved to harness Air ether to traverse their environment at high speeds, disorient their prey, and escape danger when necessary. One well-placed strike is often all it takes to leave the creatures incapacitated. Conversely, one well-placed strike from a galeaper can also spell a swift end. This is the core of their predatory instincts. Fortunately, the young examples before us aren’t well-attuned to their natural affinity for Air yet.
