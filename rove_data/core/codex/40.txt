Absorption Without Assimilation
*Days prior, Mo speaks as the party begins their hike through the valley—*
“Rovers, I expect that throughout these mountains we will encounter several urns. They are irritating pests that consume every last thing around them. The only value they create is much of what they digest becomes converted into small bits of ether that is secreted through their shells—producing those crystals they are so known for. Excellent sources of lyst, but usually a disaster for anything that lives close.
“Starlings, myself as well, view this process as somewhat perplexing… but can’t help but be envious still. Freely converting active energy into inactive energy has potent implications, but their process is exceedingly wasteful. It is also all they do. Powerful creatures that hold so much potential within them. Yet, slowly, ceaselessly, stupidly, they store all of that energy to never be felt or experienced. I think you will find that Makaal and myself will put that lyst to far better use should you bring it back with you!”
