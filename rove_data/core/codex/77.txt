With A Bitter Look
Mo watches as the Rovers draw close to the great wedge of ether. Suddenly, the whinny of a crown echoes from beneath the cliff’s edge. Its hooves clap loudly against the rock as it runs straight up the side of the rock–uncaring of the demands gravity would make of it. The theran easily crests over the cliff with one final leap and crashes into the ground next to the other boulder of ether overlooking the valley.
A peal of thunder shakes the entire cliff and drives the beasts surrounding the ether into a frenzy. The unease Mo had been feeling is sharpened by the commotion. The crown’s eyes widen and its muzzle opens into a soundless shriek; a wave of pure emotion bursts from the ether crystal and pours into every orifice of the crown. Stress, fear, thrill; all bundled inside a massive shell of Crux ether. Bolts of lightning launch forth from the antlers of the crown, the beast no longer in control of their own body or energies.
