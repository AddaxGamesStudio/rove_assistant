You can’t know the service you’ve accomplished for me, Rovers. Marii was a burden—**WEAK PITIFUL IRRELEVANT**—the last vestige of a life I’ve long since wished to erase. Now I’m free—**I’M FREE I’M FREE I’M FREE**—to wield the clan as I’ve truly desired and usher order unto Chorus.
Femii’s head snaps over to gaze upon Marii’s body. She chuckles to herself, the hisses and rasps of the laugh echoing off of the chamber walls. Her skara stalks toward the body ever so slowly. In a blink it impales Marii on a limb and drags it back to its endless maw—grinding, crushing, pulverizing the former queen. 
Femii tilts her head back and emits a shriek that echoes through what feels like the entire mountain. Within moments a stream of enthralled soldiers and therans scramble into the chamber from the entry tunnel.
