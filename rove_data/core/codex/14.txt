Close Dungeon Of Innumerous Boughs
The last of you manages to press into the recess that the two merchants and their draught beast were hidden away within. As you prepare to clear a path for the escort-and-retreat, the starling Mo motions to you and Silky. “Rovers, perhaps you would like to discuss… an extended partnership?” Makaal cracks a smile and nods along with the suggestion.
He motions to the equipment each of you brought along. “While those seem like… fine weapons for dealing with young galeaper and pesky silvans, perhaps you would be more interested in exchanging them for something crafted by expert keb rasska technique and starling proficiency?” He excitedly slaps a box strapped to Grandpaw, eliciting a low bark from the arkenyn.
“Really, this setback has changed our plans quite a bit. What say you let us tag along for a time? We can offer our services; Mo’s expert crafting, my own keen eye for opportunity, and Grandpaw’s enduring sten—strength, to carry all of your supplies!” Makaal proclaims with a gleam to his eyes and a smile to match.
