Of Good And Ill
Your hands grip something far clammier than you expected when sorting through this pile. When you wrest free your finding, you are met with a surprisingly large eyeball staring back. Or, no, not a literal eyeball but something created to appear as one. A round crystal of morph lies suspended in a perfectly polished sphere of amber.
It pulses as you move it to and fro, giving off the illusion of following you in an unblinking gaze. Another relic of the clan that could have some potential in controlling the ambient Morph ether.
