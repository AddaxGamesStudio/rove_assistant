Take The Ether
Eclipse’s skin radiates with swirls of color as his captured ether threatens to rend his very flesh. His eyes dart from threat to threat, sweat dripping from his face. He looks to Andiron, panting with both heads hanging low, and his breath calms as he draws upon his last cache of energy. 
“**You have exhausted my mercy, whelps! Chorus cries out for help and here you are, leaning on one another just to stand up! You think you can end this strife, this suffering? It was people like you that let things fall this far! I pulled down the sky itself, I hold power no one else can even comprehend! I alone have the strength to set the world to right!**” 
He reaches both hands to the lodestone and pulls towards himself. Light shoots out the stone as the crack propagates along its many faces, fracturing smaller and smaller as ever wisp of ether is rapidly sucked out and absorbed by the vibrating core shards of Eclipse.
You’ve never felt this pressure, this vacuum of missing ether before. There’s none left anywhere nearby. It’s terrifying, until suddenly the thought clicks in your mind. There’s no more, anywhere nearby! Eclipse has no further reserves, no more outside strength to rely upon. Once you neutralize the ether contained in his body he will be left with only his own weak faculties.
