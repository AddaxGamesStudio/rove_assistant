Rock On
Staggering forward with an expression of utter disbelief, the harrow who has drawn upon the ether suddenly finds himself unable to balance his disproportionate frame. With a final, rasping exhale, he falls—his immense body striking the ground with a dull, resounding thud. Before any of you can approach, a streak storms through the valley. A muffled popping and tearing is the only sign anything at all happened. Already above the caps of the fulgurshrooms, the avian has the Star Hunter’s entire intact arm gripped in its talons—complete with embedded starling core hosting all of his stolen ether. A beat later, the rest of the clan members scattered throughout this understory realize their objective was still successful and flee with all due haste, some even cheering loudly.
Mo continues looking at the sky in disbelief. In an eerie display, the starling begins collecting their tools from Grandpaw without moving their head at all. Stifled movements carry them towards the fallen crown, where they begin to harvest the body in the otherwise usual fashion you’ve grown accustomed to after your battles, but the starling’s attention never fully leaves the sky, focused almost entirely upon The Seat of Storms. After some time, the crafter’s work is complete, having fashioned equipment from the residual ether of the crown.
“Is this how it’s going to be? Chasing the dying souls left behind?” Mo finally asks. Silky lands atop the starling’s head, causing their tendrils to writhe in surprise. “Focus. I understand how you see your own plight mirrored in these creatures, but we need to ensure Addax Uzem—or his pursuants—aren’t the cause of a catastrophe. We move forward and reflect later,” he says, motioning towards the great shrine with one wing.
