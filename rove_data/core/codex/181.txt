Victory!
The final foe takes a suitably dramatic moment to fall to the ground, with an out-sized thud. The hazy reaches of the arena shift into night, stars unobstructed except for sudden flashes of light and color. A cacophony of cheers, shouts, and thundering applause rings out from the crowd. The dazzling multi-colored sparks filling the sky quickly spell out each of your names before fading away. 
Each of you receives a wink and blown kiss from your favored supporter before the trumpets start back up with a triumphant tune. Entire bouquets fly through the air, though they also manage to just miss striking you. The Thought Caser steps from their booth, the railing breaking to mist as they walk through it, before dashing downwards to form a staircase. 
Your keb rasska guide congratulates you all, somehow managing to shake only one of your limbs with all of theirs, the keb on their back expressing concentrated glory. And then you are looking at the back of your eyelids, the plush of the carpet beneath you molded to your sleeping form.
You open your eyes to see the incense quickly dispersing from the room, your host gathering up the ether twine from around you. They congratulate each of you again before handing you a bag burgeoning with your well-earned lyst. “Excellent fighting,” your host praises. “I hope you don’t find reality too ‘mundane’ after the splendor of the dream.”
