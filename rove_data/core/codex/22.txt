Taken a Toll
Grandpaw can be heard chasing the rest of the beasts and remaining Nah, the title Zeepurah labeled the twisted tihfur with, out of the village grounds. His deep growls and howls surprisingly bring some calm back to the area. Zeepurah collapses to one knee and buries her talons in the dirt for support. The gleam of Silky’s aerios can be seen just overhead—watching patiently.
“He was lost to us in the mires at the edge of the Taharik. We took great pride in keeping the forest free of predators. It was a game for us—to compete between one another to bring home the greatest quarry. There was a dawn where he didn’t return. Then… something happened. I felt it… I felt him succumb. He always thought so highly of himself…”
After a few beats of her wings and steadying breaths, Zeepurah rises and faces away from the turmoil of the village. “I hadn’t imagined he would root himself so deeply and so quickly. Forgiveness asked, Rovers, for I still require your assistance.” She rips at the dirt, casting up clods of dark soil and shredded foliage. “Please. There aren’t enough of us to stop it.” She wipes the tears from her eyes and tries to collect herself. “We must stop him from tainting this place any further.”
