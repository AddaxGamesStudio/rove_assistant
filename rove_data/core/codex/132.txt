A Dangerous Road
In the oppressive gloom of the Unsouled Barrens, the Bonespire stands as a dark sentinel, its malignant aura suffusing the surrounding land with a creeping despair. To gaze upon it is to feel the crushing grip of ancient, and hateful forces—forces that whisper of lost and forbidden history, promising only ruin and madness to those who dare to seek its cursed secrets.
Standing alone against the gloom was Ozendyn, who was potentially moments from being lost to the frenzy before you had arrived. He seems renewed by your appearance and subsequent assistance in his fight. If it wasn’t already obvious from the decay spotted on your approach, it’s more than obvious now that the Bonespire stirs with activity that is ushering the sudden expansion of the Barrens. While the region is terrifying, its relative isolation within the continent means most were content to simply avoid it entirely, its dangers never reaching beyond its own boundaries.
Ozendyn suggests he has additional fighters—young zusag who had been not-so-subtly trailing him across the wastes—who can help with your investigation of the Barrens and help you find the source of the turmoil at the heart of the Bonespire, but they’ll require convincing that until now he had been unable to garner. An elder zusag being followed by his band of Rovers, and merchants besides? Surely an accord could be struck with such a well-loaded die.
