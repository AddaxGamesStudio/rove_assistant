Truth Cannot Know Itself
The skara grub suddenly slams itself against the too-thin passage. It begins trying to claw and chew its way through furiously, as if possessed. Kelo and Saras show no reaction to the skara’s sudden change in behavior, instead turning to face your group with a new despondence bearing on their expressions. They each draw their ezmenite blades and stalk toward you.
“Apologies, Rovers. This ruse was necessary.” Kelo drones. “Suddenly showing yourselves… this complicated matters. As the instrument of Femii’s accords, this must be completed.” He assumes a combat stance and presses intangibly against your minds, conveying emotions equal parts guilt for the siblings’ deception and obligation to their clan. Saras casts one last glance at him, then turns away with a hiss, flashing her blade towards you.
Another wave of emotion crashes over you all, this one coming from the passage obscured by the skara.
