They Can Only Shriek
*The black birds in their sable throng,*
*Sung dirges where the lost belong.*
*Their feathers rustled in the fetid breeze,*
*A mournful wail loosed through gnarled and dead trees.*

Uproar grips the marsh. Kifa squeal and begin attacking one another in the sky. Briarwogs groan and start to wade from their brooding pools back into the forest. Grovetenders crash their way through smaller trees without a care to the injuries they suffer to their own bodies. You can hear the screams of the Yanshif clan from within the forest as they call out to the song of their leader.
Mo trembles as they work to separate the hide from the corpse of the briarbull. “I never truly understood. This is what Nu meant. Ether carries emotion no matter what form it takes…” the starling continues musing quietly to themself, likely a distraction to stave off the cloying atmosphere descending upon the region. Makaal quietly tries to calm Grandpaw down, his theran companion clearly fighting every last instinct to literally run for the mountains.
It’s time to finish the culling of the Taharik, lest its aberrant beasts spill out across the rest of Lalos.
