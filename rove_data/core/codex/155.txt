Equipoise Regent
All of you gasp as the final ether node harmonizes with The King of Storms. You hadn’t even realized how difficult it was to breathe, the immense pressure of the ether making the Seat of Storms feel like the bottom of the ocean. Yet now, as you watch you can see ether of all kinds flowing between Uzem and the nodes, rapidly equalizing as the loose ether around you concentrates into the great Addax.
The King of Storms slows to a canter, then trot, before calming completely, the ether washing over him and restoring his form. It starts with his majestic antlers, the cracks filling with golden flames before sealing shut, then flows down his mane which suffuses with a cool blue light before settling back to its regal sky-blue color. Air ether streaks down his form cleaning the dirt, blood, and sweat from his coat, the splotches of color quickly knitting back together to that of a perfect, pillowy cloud. At last he stomps his hooves with the rumble of an earthquake, shattering their outermost layer and revealing shiny new keratin beneath.
Before they can stop themself, Mo steps forward offering a tendril to Uzem. With a snort the Addax presses his snout to Mo’s tendril. Lightning seems to step from Uzem’s antlers to Mo’s arm before completely surrounding the starling in crackling electricity. In a burst the lightning streaks out to connect to all of you, and feel incredible power flowing through your nerves deep into your bones. 
“For once, I’m jealous not to be there in person!” Silky quips through his aerios. “It seems Addax Uzem has given all of you a portion of his immense power.” As Uzem steps away and moves deeper into the inner sanctum, Makaal reaches out for his friend. 
“That felt startlingly like when I first developed awareness. Like floating on a great ether ocean, my core lifted by the gentle waves. I felt connected to my siblings; for a second I could have even sworn that Uzem himself has some sort of core…” They trail off, cradling Nu’s core in a pair of tendrils. 
Makaal goes to pat Mo on the back, only to stop short, his eyes going wide. He unsheathes the weapon Mo had strapped to their back, lifting it for you to see. The surface seems to swirl with ether, like glass over dancing mists. It has been deeply infused with ether, giving it newfound power to match your own advancement.
