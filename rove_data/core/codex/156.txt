The King of Storms
Before leaving Makaal asks to revisit the hollow where your first real test as a team took place. Your entrance spooks a small nest of streak which flee past you, cawing their annoyance at being disturbed. It is shocking to see how quickly time seems to have moved on from you not-too-far past battle. 
The hollow looks like the Thunder Mesa in miniature, with streams flowing full of rain water, plants and fungi feeding on the final scraps of the galeaper queen’s chitin, and fingernail-sized creatures feasting on the latent ether, all derived from Uzem and his storms.
Makaal enters, holding the weapon crafted from the galeaper queen’s wing. “Back where it all began, and because of the Star Hunters again! Despite all the hardship this journey has brought, Rovers, I can truly say that I am awed by the progress and knowledge we have gained.” He holds the weapon aloft, “How much of my own craft I have needed to learn since this was wrought, to properly outfit such warriors as you!”
Silky chimes in, “I never imagined the Star Hunters would be so bold as to confront Uzem on his throne, and yet here you stand, able to stare down the storm itself! This act alone shall keep your names in the history scrolls for generations to come, Rovers!”  
The aerios flies to the entrance of the hollow, “And yet, the threat persists. The Star Hunter clan must be dealt with, root and stem.” He laughs at a sudden realization, “I do not believe that first stormcaller and her clan expected the ‘storm’ to be you, the champions of Uzem!”
