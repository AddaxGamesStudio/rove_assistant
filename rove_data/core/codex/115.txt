Feel The Bright Eyes
Doing his best to serve as a beacon in the dark, Silky swoops through the village in an effort to guide everyone away from the village. “We’re out of time! Our position here isn’t defensible and we have our less-combative gleaners to protect! Gather what you care to and follow me, follow me!” he cries.
Grandpaw’s heavy galloping can be heard just beyond the moat. As he travels the wider berth around the outside of the village, the rest of you cut through back the way you came to safer grounds. As you turn and look back, a swarm of broken vessels crashes into the remaining tihfur skulking about the edges of the village grounds. They drive their tendrils into the bodies of the monstrous villagers and both entities emit screams of pain and despair during the process.
Silky continues leading you on to link back up with the merchants. Grandpaw lets out a quiet bark and spits out a severed talon; the remnants of a Yanshif that thought to get in the way of a charging arkenyn. Makaal can be heard whispering quiet prayers. Mo is nearly motionless—lost in some thought process.
