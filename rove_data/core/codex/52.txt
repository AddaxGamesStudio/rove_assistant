*Ether takes on myriad forms, disciples. The snow that falls upon our mountain perch, the wind that cuts through the peaks and valleys, the conjurations we contemplate and manifest… but more commonly, it seems to take the inert form of crystals. While not immediately reactive, most crystals are but a single action from unleashing their latent, and often potent, energy.

A catalyst for any endeavor!*
