Vault
*They tickled timid tails, tried tap-dancing too,*
*tumbling through tall toadstools till the twilight turned blue.*
*The trio told tall tales beneath a towering tree.*
*Together they were trouble, so tumultuous, it was true!*

*The triplets were thoroughly tantalized by the tales.*
*A tower at the heart of the Barrens surely held treasures that none had tried to thieve.*
*They would surely earn their ranks by braving such terrifying trails.There would be no suggestion that the brothers three would strive to underachieve.*

“In what world does another group of people have the same idea to climb this forsaken tower at the exact same time we do?!” cries a shrill voice as you all pile into the chamber. A zusag with brightly colored ears—ink marking him as a balatronist, an associate that has subverted the expectations of their teachers to the point of belligerence—peeks out from a crumbled pile of brick.
Another zusag at the opposite end of the room—similarly marked to the first—leaps up at the sound of their sibling’s cries. “No, this just makes it all the better! Look at them, they’re Rovers! They’ll surely up the ante on our feat here,” he says, clapping.
A third zusag—a third balatronist—peers out from a large construct in the corner of the room. “You seem to be headed up, and we were frankly wondering how we would head out. I suspect that means you’ve given us a clear shot back down the tower. In that case, let’s make it a friendly competition then! Any of our boxes here you’re free to keep… if you can get to them before we can! LET’S HOP TO IT!” he shouts. After he does, another few zusag appear seemingly out of nowhere, all ready to join in the game they had concocted.
