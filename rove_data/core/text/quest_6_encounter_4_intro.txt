[artwork=Zipahudi the Briarbull]
Marshes aren’t known for smelling nice even without undue contamination. Waste. Decay. Rot. Death. A festering cauldron whose contents cling to the air itself long before anything can think to sample its vile brew. Each step ejects more of the foul haze upwards. Carried on the wind is a palpable force that presses upon you and leaves your voices hoarse. Tears well up in Grandpaw’s eyes but he doesn’t give voice to his suffering—likely in the hopes of not inhaling more of the fetid air than necessary.
This marsh stands as the border between the Taharik and the southernmost swamp along the coast of Lalos. Normally it would be where the tihfur clan would hunt intruders and harvest reagents from its fertile wetland. Today it is an open-air sepulcher, festooned in the adornments of the briarwog brood that calls it home. Decaying silvans add their own splash of sickly color to the vista.
Pulsating stone masses crest the surface of the swamp waters at the far end of the marsh. An immense briarbull presides over the rotten cesspools, his hide mired in violet and ebony hues, his spines dripping with a venom no doubt all the worse for the inclusion of the Morphic miasma. A lone briarbull rutting in a single marsh couldn’t be the source of this wilde-spread pollution, but slaying it is a boon to anything that enjoys breathing clean air and drinking clean water.
