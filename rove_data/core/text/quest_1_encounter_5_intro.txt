[artwork=Ahma]
Moonlight pours into the pallid grove, revealing shades of sickly browns and revolting purples; all with a cloying blanket of grimy Morphic scum. Grandpaw had refused to draw near the ichor stream you all crossed, much less travel across the bridge that was once Hokmala, and so Mo and Makaal stayed behind, hoping to stop any of the Nah from stalking back into the evacuated village. 
As if presenting its tapestry for the world to see, a monstrous avian sits in the center of the grove with one pair of its myriad wings spread wide. Its reverie is quickly extinguished as your group approaches. A pale skull with three eyes full of rancor, woe, and death gaze across each of you before finally falling on Zeepurah. The skull spins in place, clattering and wobbling with uncertainty. Top down, bottom up, side to side; no perspective brings it satisfaction. Finally it lets its beak fall open.
**“W H Y ?”**
“Hasayon, my love… This should have never happened.” Zeepurah reaches out towards the monster with one wavering hand.
**“W E  S A V E  T H E M,**
**L I K E  Y O U  S A V E D  M E,**
**W E  A R E  B U T  C H I L D R E N,**
**W E  C A N  S T I L L  S I N G,**
**T O G E T H E R.”**
“This is oblivion, Hasayon! Do you not see the decay? The sickness? There is no balance, no order! Unbridled is your requiem!” Showers of feathers are cast with each frantic motion of her body—each one thin and frayed.
**“D O  Y O U  N O T  E N J O Y  M Y  S O N G,**
**F O R G I V E  M E  M Y  M U S E,**
**I  D O  N O T  K N O W  O T H E R  N O T E S,**
**T E A C H  M E.”**
The Ahma—Hasayon—opens his beak wider and begins to moan. It is an otherworldly tone that vibrates through your entire being. While distressing, it seems to have affected Zeepurah much worse, her talons are clutched to her head and she trembles violently. After a few moments she rears back, shrieking up at the night sky. Hasayon echoes her despair with the same fervor. The air stales. The ground churns. The forest weeps. The entire world seems to grow black at the edges.
Then it all stops as Hasayon’s song is interrupted with an expulsion of Morphic sludge from his visage. It pours from his eyes, his beak, his neck. Zeepurah regains a measure of composure and shakily draws her bow.
**“T O O  S O O N.”**
