*Scratchpad of Thought Caser Kivri — Recorded Exercises*
*“Stay focused, fighters! Feel the frost’s chill, the shiver sliding over skin. Steel yourself! Move forward, stay fast, stay firm. Vanquish fear, then visualize victory. Sift through the noise, sharpen those senses, then strike—swiftly, silently, surely.*
*Embrace the silence. The faintest frequency reveals everything. Feel the rhythm, the sensations of the field. Precision strikes slice through even the strongest shields. Save your strength—force, flow, ferocity.”*

Makaal takes a shuddering breath as he scratches behind Grandpaw’s ears, eliciting pleased grunts from the arkenyn. The Rovers had completed another impossible task and Makaal wasn’t entirely sure what the future held as a result. Based on Silky’s behavior, the worst had yet to come, and Makaal felt as if he should at least try to contribute to the preparations.
The merchant reached down into an inner pocket of his cloak. After a few moments of digging, he felt what he was searching for, and pulled out a small, carved portion of chitin. Mo immediately twisted their attention toward Makaal and several of their tendrils seemed attracted to the chitin. “Silky!” the merchant called out, trying to draw the attention of the elder zusag away from his current round of scouting.
A few beats later the aerios glides into view. He descends upon Grandpaw’s head, to which the arkenyn chuffs and twitches his head ever so slightly in complaint. Makaal holds up the carved icon for Silky to inspect. “Call it a merchant’s intuition, but I feel as if things are about to get much more dangerous. Never let it be said I’m not prepared!”
Mo suddenly claps. “That’s a ration chit! It must be for a different clan though, as I don’t recognize the print. Why would you have one of those, Makaal?” the starling asks. Makaal’s face takes on a smug grin.
“I helped make a supply run for a clan that, if I remember right, is rather close by! This isn’t just any old ration chit; it’s the ‘call in a favor’ chit. The clan boasts about the skill of their Thought Caser.” Makaal turns to face the aerios, still wearing his smug expression. Silky leans forward to inspect the piece of chitin even closer.
“A keb rasska Thought Caser? Makaal, my boy, you would put a clan of the Mouth to absolute shame! This is an excellent idea, yes, yes, most excellent indeed! This is a perfect opportunity for our Rovers to stretch their legs even further. A full battle played out in a shared mental environment! No Claw-built sparring arena could ever hope to compare. Let us depart immediately!”
