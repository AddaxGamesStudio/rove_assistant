Every step deeper into the Taharik comes with some sort of added challenge. Unstable footing, gnarled tree roots, shrouds of Morphic spores, pools of muck and grime. Requiring even more care is the swirling moat of rancid Morph essence surrounding the ruins of a tihfur village. Displaced soil and collapsed trees give you a viable crossing, but its presence is deeply unsettling, and not even your ether-fortified bodies would withstand a plunge into its depths for very long.
Many of the homes that were once suspended in the treetops now lie shattered and broken in heaps on the forest floor. Rotten timber surrounds the ruins having either pierced or become buried in the wreckage of the hovels. Distressed tihfur monstrosities shuffle through the village, kicking at fallen carvings or digging through mounds of garbage.
Swirling overhead and haranguing the tihfur are faintly glowing beings of pure Morph. Each time they make contact with one another, the malformed starlings begin to screech uncontrollably as the tihfur pulls away and cackles. Silky gasps and lets out a stream of curses, more quietly than before. “Broken Vessels... that’s what Mo was sensing. I’ll put it this way; the only place, literally the only place, that we know of their appearance is the Unsouled Barrens. Which means to see them not only outside of the Barrens, but this far from it, suggests dire circumstances. We must hurry, Rovers. Time is very much not with us here.”
Silky performs a quick flying survey and circles back to point out areas in the village worth investigating. He urges you to find the potential source of the Morphic surge, suggesting that it may have originated here within the Yanshif’s now-broken homes. Silky emphasizes the importance of time, and that no matter what you discover, you cannot stay here as the concentration of Morph is growing and poses too substantial a risk to everyone’s bodies.
