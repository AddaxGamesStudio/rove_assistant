*Eclipse stands directly beneath the floating archipelago of Era. Its islands visible through the jagged opening in the cavern roof above. They were quiet, peaceful, incapable of knowing what plagued the world beneath. One hand traces along the back of Andiron’s spine, the other is twisted upward towards one of the islands overhead.*
*He grips one of the larger starling cores embedded in the beast’s spine, stirring the higher concentration of Anima ether he had focused through Andiron’s body. Their twin heads begin to snarl, but they just as quickly release their temper, knowing full well that they had been nurtured for this. Then it was time to call upon the Arcana swirling within his own body. Hundreds of starlings had been judged and selected for their composition. Such precarious balance that elevated him and his companion above all others. But it was only the first step. Paltry in comparison to what Eclipse knew could be achieved.*
*Punctured along the cavern wall are numerous ether spikes harvested from the Thunder Mesa. The pure essence of Air wrought by Uzem’s innumerable bolts of lightning, and the solid essence of Earth excavated where no other forces could hope to spoil its purity. The right combination, the right technique, the right timing…*
*He would make sure the starlings understood just what their name for him truly meant.*

The shockwave hits you before anything else. It wraps the world in a blanket of complete and utter silence. No scream, no moan, no whimper will deny its theft of voice.
Then comes the wind. It crashes against your bodies and squeezes around you like the hand of an invisible colossus. This pressure does not care whether your body is made of flesh, metal, rock, fire—you will bend. You will break.
A wall of dust and debris follows. Pebbles and splinters slash across your bodies with the force of small explosives. It batters you relentlessly. It demands that you fall.
Hundreds of shadows obscure the sky—rocks, trees, bodies. They are cast across the entirety of Lalos with apocalyptic force. You are far enough away that none of it threatens to collide with you, but not far enough to be spared the sight of the carnage spilling out across the continent.
Sheer jubilation echoes through the valley. Star Hunters pour out from either side of the mountain pass, elated that their leader had managed to wield enough power to literally make the sky fall. The greatest success for the clan yet.
Then one of the clan notices the party of shocked and dismayed travelers. A row of people arranged like an audience in the furthest seats of the theater to a performance of unfathomable destruction. She laughs and cheers to her fellows, readies her bow, and begins dreaming of the coming celebration feasts.
