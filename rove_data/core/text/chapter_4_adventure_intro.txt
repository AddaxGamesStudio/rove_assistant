*Notes from Tuor’s bestiary*
*Were the kaleido’s movements more predictable, we could at least estimate a timetable for when and where certain latitudes might be in danger. Not only are the kaleido’s movements rather difficult to determine, but the constant release of her urn offspring are almost as devastating. Give her one solid day of activity and she’s created a massive hollow that could collapse an entire field, with her progeny creating enough culverts to practically divert a river.*
*Getting close enough to study her in detail is a lethal endeavor for certain, to say nothing of the potential devastation she’s already carved beneath the northern stretch of Lalos. I truly hope there wasn’t a commune somewhere along her path; if there was, they’re assuredly all dead. I don’t think Tuor is in danger specifically, though we are right on the edge of one of her potential tunnel routes which may cause difficulty with future construction.*
*This is a difficult problem to solve. I can’t begin to calculate just how many warriors would be necessary. We know of two clans at direct risk from her migrations, but I doubt even the combined efforts of three clans would be enough without significant casualties. I am leaving the orange indicator in this entry for now.*
*We may want to consider upgrading to red upon later review.*

Silky resisted every instinct in his body pushing him to celebrate. Apex. His own personal collection of accounts had only ever recorded a single Apex Rover. Here he was fostering a new generation of them. He just wished it didn’t have to come at the expense of so much peril. On that note…
“Mo, how would you like to experience the greatest challenge of your life as an artisan?” he prompted. The starling tilted their head in consideration. “The greatest challenge, so far?” they tease back. Silky chuckles softly. 
“Even better, you get to exact a bit of revenge on an old nemesis…”
