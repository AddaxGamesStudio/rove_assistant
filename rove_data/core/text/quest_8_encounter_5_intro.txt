[artwork=The King of Storms]
The shrine lies beneath a sky that simmers with muted anger, heavy clouds violet and ash-gray swirling above like the echoes of a storm long spent but not forgotten. Deep within its heart stands Addax Uzem, a figure of now-faded majesty, his once-regal form diminished. His body, fractured and flickering, seems cobbled together from shards of stormlight and trailing wisps of cloud. His antlers, though cracked and worn, still spark with feeble arcs of lightning that fizzles into the air with quiet defiance. He is no longer the tempest given flesh, but the breath before the final thunderclap—a dying storm still potent enough to shatter continents.
The Star Hunters encircle him, their eyes alight with the avarice of those who believe they can plunder a King. Their bodies glow faintly, tethered by crude leashes of ether that siphon the remnants of Uzem’s power into the starling cores embedded within their bodies. The air trembles with their collective groans. “It’s almost done!” one man snarls, his voice thick with triumph. 
The King of Storms rears, and though his body shudders with the effort, the skies respond. The first bolt of lightning lances downward with a sound that splits the world, shattering the circle and sending the humans sprawling. The arc of light leaps from one to another, coursing through their bodies with merciless precision. They scream, but their cries are drowned by the deafening roar of thunder that follows, rolling through the valley like the echo of a leader’s verdict. The storm’s fury, drawn from the last vestiges of Uzem’s strength, is a purging inferno—neither righteous nor cruel, but absolute.
When the final human falls, reduced to a smoldering husk, the clearing, too, falls silent. Uzem sways on his feet, his form flickering as though he might finally dissolve into the air. Yet he remains, battered but unbroken, his cracked antlers still glowing faintly in the dim light. From the shadows at the edge of the hollow, the clan’s beasts begin to emerge. They move hesitantly, their steps laden with both grief and reverence. They offer their silent loyalty to the being whose power has humbled their masters. The skies do not clear—the air is still bitter with hate. 
The aerios makes one more lap around the upper rim of the shrine and returns to settle along an edge, peering down at The King of Storms pacing wearily deep within the inner sanctum. “Uzem has been torn asunder, aspects of his being split across reflections of Crux that sought out the closest thing to their original host, and so his progeny had been caught in the conflict. It seems our efforts managed to buy him enough time to strike back, but not enough to reclaim his splinters. We can buy time for the Crucial aspects, but should that not succeed, be prepared to quell the coming storm with your own power.”
