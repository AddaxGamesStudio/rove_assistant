[artwork=Galeaper Queen]
*Transcribed musings from “Silky,” Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*The singular pursuit of power is one that only ends in tragedy. Nothing better embodies a thoughtless reach for strength than the Star Hunter clan. Humans are well-known for their unusual adaptability—what twisted thoughts drove that clan to exploit themselves and others we may never know. If we must kill one another to empower ourselves, are we not driving ourselves further to the brink we seek to avoid?*

The stormcaller runs her hands along the carapace of the tumescent galeaper broodmother. From midge to matriarch, the entoman has been her partner for years. Whether their prey was starling, crown, or even Uzem himself, they both understand that this is their responsibility; The King of Storms has to be brought to heel. While her clan works to fracture the seat of his power deep below, she would let her companion claim this upper hollow as her own. What a beautiful thing! To see your companion flourish to the peak of her form. To fill a false monarch’s castle with her vibrant brood. Both stormcaller and galeaper can not help but salivate at the prospect of harvesting the power of The Seat of Storms for themselves.
Hissing, squealing, wailing—dozens of young galeaper stream in, clamoring for safety and succor from their mother. The stormcaller realizes this will be her companion’s first real test. A queen must be able to rule her territory and enrich her subjects. One final time the stormcaller lets loose a gentle gust of wind along the queen’s inarticulate wings, reminding her of the days when they used to leap together along streams of ether. Then it is time to say goodbye. The human sprints to the end of a great bough and unleashes her power, raw energy pumping through the Air-aspected crystals, harvested from unwitting prey, impaled through her hands and legs. A crack of thunder and a flash of lightning disguise her departure; the sheets of rain obscuring her form.
Just as obscured by the blinding light is the glittering conjuration belonging to a certain elder zusag, ever watchful of any development within his purview. Nothing more could be left to chance. Lalos, and perhaps the entirety of Chorus, balances on a precarious edge. That a member of the Star Hunter clan would try and invade Uzem’s Throne meant their power was growing too dangerous to be left unchecked. Silky would see his team through that ordeal eventually, but first he needed to be sure the Rovers could contend with more… conventional dangers. Dangers such as a nesting galeaper queen birthing enough spawn to populate an entire valley.
