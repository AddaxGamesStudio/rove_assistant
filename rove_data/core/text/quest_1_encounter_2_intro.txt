*Transcribed excerpt from a presentation by “Silky,” resident Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*Many of our own clans are content simply hiding our homes from prying eyes and letting that which draws near pass over us as would a harmless breeze. Should you, during your travels, find yourself suddenly surrounded by creatures that bear three eyes, it is no reason to balk! Tihfur clans take a more… proactive approach. Patrolling, hunting, stalking; any number of things that draw them out of their homes and into the wilds to ensure nothing would threaten that safety. Offer them the same attitude you would any fellow associate and you will more than likely find yourself a guest of the night’s feasts and festivities. Take the opportunity to inquire about their territory and how they defend it, then marvel at how the oft-reserved tihfur become an excited font of pride as they regale the stories and strategies that fill their nights.*

The wretched screech of the strange tihfur now fills the distant woods, choking out any other cries. “I’ve dealt with many clans of kin in my life, and while some of them might be more or less unusual, they’ve never behaved… like that.” Makaal anxiously swings his arms through the air. “Guiding you through their territory, inviting you back to their home, stalking you until you depart their lands… any reaction to be found under the skies but that. It’s not the way of things!” Grandpaw snorts agreeably and Mo’s tendrils writhe irritably.
As the group tears through branches and bramble trying to follow the strange noises to their source, Grandpaw suddenly rears back and snaps his snout wildly through the air—punctuated by an ear-splitting crack of splintered wood—then releases his jaws and lets the previously unseen arrow fall to the dirt. Makaal scrambles atop Grandpaw as the movement nearly throws him aside. “Cut the cauda! What—”
His swearing is interrupted when a deep bellowing shakes the treetops around the party. Silky’s aerios folds in on itself before launching skyward for safety. A woman’s voice calls from the other side of the trees. “Forgiveness asked!” she exclaims hurriedly. “I shot first without questioning what I saw. If you’ve come looking for my clan, I’m not sure that I—” before she can finish, another voice, similar to the distorted tihfur that led you this way, pierces the thicket. 
**“COMING TO HELP. I CAN’T SEE YOU!”**
In the center of the clearing stands a lone tihfur woman, doing her best to contend with a stampede of aggressive beasts trying to slip past her volley of arrows. She clearly needs help. Not wasting any more time, Mo and Makaal work to pull a copse of saplings apart for the rest of you to dive through.
