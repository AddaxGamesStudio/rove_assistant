*“Patience,” the stormcaller murmurs. The harrow following him nod, their eyes fixed on the infused crown, every muscle coiled as if the tension of the moment has seeped into their very flesh. The crown’s body seems fluid, yet defined, as though sculpted from the purest spring. Its antlers curve like delicate waves frozen mid-crest, their glow illuminating the mist that clings to the wood. Every movement is a rippling of liquid grace.*
*At the man’s subtle gesture, the various dekaha rooted throughout the hollow’s ceiling begin to stir. Their vines creep forward with deliberate intent. They strike first, their tendrils darting through the air with a serpentine swiftness, wrapping around the crown’s delicate legs. The creature rears, its body splashing apart for an instant before reforming, an elegant cascade that leaves glistening droplets hanging in the air. It makes a bolt back towards the upper ring of the hollow, but the harrow surge forward, their feet churning the slowly flooding hollow into a frenzy. One throws a weighted net, rife with jagged crystals of Earth ether, which falls over the crown’s glowing body. The creature bucks and thrashes, its antlers flashing with bursts of crystalline water that are cast like shards of ice, but the net holds firm.*
*He raises his hands, and the pools around the crown rise in answer, liquid tendrils forming a swirling cage. The enthralled dekaha reaffirm their hold, their vines pulsing as if drawing strength from what they ensnared. The crown lets out a mournful cry, a sound like the wail of a distant tide, before collapsing into stillness, its form dimming but not dissolving. The Star Hunter kneels beside it, placing an impaled hand on its glistening flank. His complement, still panting from the chase, watch in silence as the stormcaller closes his eyes and begins to draw from the crown’s ether, the pools around them trembling as the energy flows into him.*

Mo holds out an arm, stopping everybody at the face of the bough trickling with water. “I sense them, but… we were too slow. I feel the ether and its turmoil, even within these small streams.” They concentrate for a moment, their tendrils slowly unspooling and floating towards the rivulets of water cascading down the bark.
“The Hunter seems to have almost completely wrested control of Uzem’s energy from its progeny. I suspect your task will be easier if you could somehow cull it, but I find myself feeling… sympathetic. Perhaps you can find a way to sever their connection and preserve the crown?” Mo posits as they fashion a set of climbing hooks out of the galeaper talons and fungal threads harvested from the fulgurcaps.
“No mercy for the wicked, Rovers,” Makaal proposes.
