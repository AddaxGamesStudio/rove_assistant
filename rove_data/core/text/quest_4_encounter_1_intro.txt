*Two starlings of the Zyderite clan share thoughts.*
*Mo, the ether always feels. Feel with the ether, rather than feeling for the ether!*
*Nu, the other crafters can barely perceive these energies. Teaching them something like “feel with the ether” is absurd. Is there something else? Flows? Cycles?*
*Mo, just… this alchemy, this crafting, is there always such rigidity? Surely there is instinct, impulse, intuition?*
*Nu… of course, just consider that few have such keen reactions. They require direct guidance before they can develop such awareness.*

Mo’s tendrils lash uncomfortably as the Rovers lead the party closer and closer to Uzem’s Throne once more. Something in the storm feels deeply unsettling, even more than when Makaal had tried to travel through this valley just before encountering Silky. It was tinged with… Emotion? Instinct? That couldn’t be right–energy didn’t come with sensations like that. It sounded like the sort of thing Nu might have said. Mo drags a tendril over the cracked remnants of their sibling wrapped at their head. Was there something else to the rains? Perhaps something else was stirring the memories, but to react like this meant it couldn’t be anything good.
Silky had suggested a much more treacherous, but direct route for their return to the shrine in the valley. Makaal had seemed unperturbed, but Mo wasn’t as comfortable with the suggestions. It was likely safer than a trip through the Unsouled Barrens, at least. A travel plan that can be summarized as “climbing the nearby mountain and relying on travel through the air along the caps of fulgurshrooms” as a way to reach the thickest part of Uzem’s Throne… it was certainly faster than climbing from the bottom, but what faith the old zusag placed in everyone! 
A broad presence suddenly assaults Mo’s senses. “Stop!” they cry. The Rovers dismount Grandpaw and take combat stances with practiced ease. Mo couldn’t help but be surprised at the amount of trust laid upon this instinct, but there would be time to explore that later. “Those massive ether crystals… something connects them? ...is connected? Someone or something hopes to stall us. Makaal, this is something for the Rovers to handle; let’s retreat.”
Makaal gave Grandpaw a pat, prompting him to lead them away from the cliff where the large ether crystals resided. Mo strained to perceive what tingled at their senses. The best they could tell was that the crystals contained far more ether than expected, and it was far more active than large crystallized ether should be.. Whatever it was, the Rovers would likely be a match for it. Their strength was a marvel Mo had only experienced at the hand of malefactors that stole their power from others. Had Silky known of their strength before? Or was this his own grand architecture?
