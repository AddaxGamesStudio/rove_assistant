*Water is a challenging element; Mo knows it in a way only a being literally made of Water-ether can. Deep under the sea the only choice is to contend with its existence. Here atop one of the tallest structures on Lalos, the starling finds a certain irony in the similarities the great tree has with the deepest depths. Light can barely penetrate its way into the sea; the foliage of the great boughs are nearly as effective at creating a pall of darkness. Currents and riptides in the sea mean you have little choice but to be carried where the waves takeyou. The massive roots of the tree that form Uzem’s Throne likely have the same effect on the ground, and those who dwell upon or within it, below. Between it all is a wealth of unique flora that grows to rely upon the difficult environment cultivated by the uncaring brutality.*
*Life truly is symmetrical.*

Mo clings tightly to Grandpaw’s back with their many legs as the group bounds smoothly from mushroom to mushroom. As the Seat of Storms draws close, Mo is shocked to see just how tremendous the ancient structure truly is. It now occurs to the starling that the hovel they had hidden in with Makaal hadn’t been a true chamber; but merely a hollow in one of the roots. Reaching the true sanctum of the addax apparently entails scaling the entirety of the shrine and descending from the top. It is fortunate the enormity of the tree means that what appears to be a sheer vertical climb is actually an almost approachable series of holloways and wide boughs that wrap around the structure. It isn’t going to be simple by any means, but Mo feels much less concerned with the logistics of climbing from bole to canopy.
Instead, Mo knows it is going to be a different kind of challenge. The storms have only gotten worse and the rain forceful enough to pose an obstacle all on their own. This time there is no doubt about the presence responsible for the deluge. Even with the barest of understanding on how, Mo can feel the emotional tint to the ether in the rain. As an avatar of storms, Air and Water are likely the arcane elements Uzem resonates with the strongest, and why Mo can feel that influence even without understanding what it was initially.
As Grandpaw finally lands the party atop a stable branch, Mo secures the finishing touches on their project, satisfied it will serve the Rovers well enough. “The next conjuration of Uzem is going to be more of a contest than its weaker aspect of Earth back on the fulgurcaps. I’ve fashioned these grapple-lines for each of you. Hooks wrought from galeaper claws, ropes of terranape vine, all fastened together with the pinions of streaks, and finally reinforced with the respective ether–they should fare even when completely drenched. If you feel you’re at risk of losing your footing in the middle of combat, these should help you secure yourselves until you’ve steadied again.”
The starling watches the Rovers hike further up the great boughs.
