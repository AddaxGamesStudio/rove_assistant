[artwork=Eclipse]
*Eclipse stood before the immense boulder of ether. The beating heart of the very island he wrenched from the sky. It pulses vibrantly with a light that is every color at once. He slammed his hands into it, palms flat against the surface, the embedded cores spiking through the lodestone. He grit his teeth and absorbed the ether into himself, one agonizing second at a time. It poured through his fingers, up his arms, into his chest—an indescribable torrent of energy that no living being should be able to withstand.*
*The lodestone cracked. A single fissure ran its length, spilling light and ether into the deepest recess of the impact crater. Eclipse growled, his skin already beginning to glow in places. He could feel himself... unraveling, not dying exactly, but becoming something else, something bigger and stranger. This broken heart of Era didn’t care about him. It didn’t care about anything. It only poured itself out, ceaseless and unrelenting.*
*Andiron whined and growled, angered at the inability to fight back this unseen threat.*

Eclipse stands before the bleeding lodestone, sitting comfortably atop his theran beast. The wisps of ether pouring from the fractures of the lodestone snake their way into the bodies of the two monsters. He languidly turns his attention to your group, smirking to himself about an unspoken joke.
“Might makes right? No, that’s not enough. How embarrassing it is to be… vulnerable.” he begins. “That is our problem. Individually, collectively, totally. Each and every one of us are VULNERABLE! If Chorus is to sustain itself, sustain us, we must cease to be so vulnerable.” He runs a hand against the flank of Andiron.
“We find solace in numbers. Pairs, clans, armies. Even beasts. Swarms, packs, flocks. So intrinsic is this vulnerability that all living things seek to bolster themselves with numbers. Yet there is one place where this is not a fact of life,” he says, pointing one finger straight into the air. The rest of Era trails overhead. Dozens of small figures can be seen floating between the islands—starlings, terrified of the sudden attack on their home.
“They lived free of fear. Free of struggle. Why not remind them what it means to be… vulnerable? How cruel of them, to selfishly withhold such power that could render us all free of this obvious flaw.” his smirk melts away, leaving behind a snarl of disgust.
Mo’s tendrils writhe in fury, but they withhold their anger towards Eclipse. Instead, they turn to face you. “Those treasures are the pinnacle of my work. You’ve all become so adept at channeling ether—these will let you take the final steps to perfect control. In, and out. Neutralize the sources of ether, and demonstrate that even Eclipse cannot escape this ‘flaw’ we all have.”
