**“HE’LL MAKE YOU ANYTHING YOU WISH TO BE!”**
A crowd of tihfur stalk their way through the trees of the grove. Some laugh, others dance, and a few even try to sing. The words are choking and halted; their throats caught between their avian shifting. Most of them are focused on a woman towards the far end of the settlement. She screeches and swings violently at any who draw close.
This lone villager seems worse off than the notably twisted members of her faction attempting to surround her. Her wiry frame is corded in broken feathers and stretches of oozing hide where the shifting seems to have gone awry. Her left side is covered in skin-carvings that pulse with potent Morph ether. The muscles writhe and are unable to fully settle on one side of her shift or the other. With each pulse of her heart the blanket of miasma flowing through the forest roils —spreading further.
A few of the tihfur leaping through the trees make a point of letting the ether wash over their bodies. Each one takes a manic delight as it causes their entire body to twitch unnaturally. Mouths peeled back in ecstasy, wings fluttering in joy, talons ripping at their feathers in a daze. All of it a disturbing scene to say the least. This is nothing like the more primal rituals that tihfur clans engage in; this is simply madness given physical shape.
“String me up to bleed,” Silky curses. “Is this what has become of the Yanshif clan? How in the world could things have grown so dire so quickly?!”
His utterance kills the jubilations of the crowd of monstrous tihfur instantly. Besides the frantic woman at the outer reach, every last member (regardless of where they stood or perched) slowly turns to face you in unison. Every trio of eyes is on you. Each visage on display is curled in visible disgust.
**“A MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES!” “FRESH MEAT!” “PLUCK AND STRIP!” “THEIR BODIES SING!”**
A cacophony of squawking cries and jeers explode through the clearing. Their emotional outbursts fill the air as they descend upon you. Even the wildlife seems caught up in their temper as malformed streaks, kifa, and even a premature rakifa demolish the branches of trees to join the fray. This spread of Morph is pressing the entire forest into rapid and distorted development at the cost of its natural vitality.
