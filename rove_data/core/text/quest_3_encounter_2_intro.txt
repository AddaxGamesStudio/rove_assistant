[artwork=Scour]
*Entry within The Barren Quire from “Earlong,” self-appointed Scribe of The Wake.*
*Does the screaming cause them fear as well? Is that what makes their behavior so erratic? If every time we opened our own mouths we frightened ourselves, how long could we go before tearing each other apart?*
*There were people here once, or so I was told. It’s not as though we have a library anywhere. Even this codex is hardly organized, not that I’m helping there. Greatest clan in Lalos, built at the very heart of the continent.*
*Heart. When the Bonespire pulses–a heartbeat? Is it that simple?*
*As simple as successfully replacing my own heart.*

Ozendyn gently closes the codex and binds it back on his hip. He has read it cover to cover multiple times over the last year, but with the arrival of the Rovers its passages held more significance than ever. Passed down from Scribe to Scribe over the lifespan of The Wake, each one expanding it, chronicling their endeavors and dwindling optimism as their mission outlived the order in the end.
The Rovers had come in like a blaze and tore their way through a brood chamber, hardly resting as they carried detritus to the merchants following in their trail. That sort of feat would have taken a team from The Wake days of planning and careful execution. When they first met, Silky had been blindingly confident in his team’s capability. The zusag’s unique construct afforded him a perspective on the Barrens that Ozendyn hadn’t heard from anybody other than the eldest members in his order. Silky suggested myriad ways in which his group could finally complete Ozendyn’s mission, and hadn’t wavered once under the barrage of confused questions about how such things were possible. 
He would not be mollified with just one display of strength, overwhelming though it had been, and so he brought the group deeper into the Barrens for what he felt would be the only way to truly be convinced. Scattered across the region in a wide perimeter surrounding the Bonespire were cracks in the ground from which turbulent Morph ether vented into the open air. These geysers were often the source of more frightening monstrosities that roamed the Barrens, weaving together rock, bone, and malice into violent creations.
If Silky felt his team had any real chance in a direct assault against the source of this madness, Ozendyn wanted to see how they fared against one of the most dangerous creations borne from it. Dubbed “scour” by a former member of his order, the beasts live up to their name. The creature’s flesh is burned from their still-shifting bones through proximity to powerful bursts of ether. The heinous fluids they generate melt the otherwise rocky landscape they reside upon.
Silky was excited to hear about the monsters in detail, labeling it as “the perfect test of faith”. It sounded more like insanity to Ozendyn, but he was more than happy not to have to participate in this “test” with the scour.
