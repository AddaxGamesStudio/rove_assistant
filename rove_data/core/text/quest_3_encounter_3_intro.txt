*Entry within The Barren Quire from “Mockhorn,” Scribe of The Wake.*
*The weapons we employ against those of Bazhar’s dominion are strongest when infused with Crux. While Fire can always be relied upon to wreak destruction, the Unsouled are brought about through pure Anima, and so the fundamentally opposing force will prove a more effective means of… unmaking.*
*This will prove challenging if the situation here remains as it stands, or worsens. Crux aligns itself with both the intangible and the symmetrical. Conjurations with their inherent temporal instability satisfy the former, and we zusag have spent generations refining the latter. Without the time or the capacity for such arts, one is left with forged weaponry, all of which are naturally very tangible. Also very difficult to create more from rock and bone, at least for those of us that remain.*
*If you are reading this, remember to keep your weapons pristine where and when possible, but above all keep your weapon balanced. Everything you do to create a more coordinated structure gives the Crux that much more strength to adhere to before it wanes.*

It was beyond belief–a notion too absurd, yet here Ozendyn stood. Silky had proven his team of Rovers could stand in the face of overwhelming strength and still claim victory.
What had he lacked? His comrades? The Wake was a clan older than Ozendyn, yet for all the years it spent deadlocked with the Unsouled Barrens, they had been whittled away down to the last.
Flapping drew his attention–Silky’s aerios descends to hover nearby, facing the Bonespire instead of the remnants of one of the single greatest dangers Ozendyn had known throughout his life. 
“Breadth. Vision. Resources,” Silky began, still facing the undulating tower that mocked Lalos. Ozendyn tilted his head back to listen. Then, with a mixture of anger and confusion churning away inside of him, he asked “You… are suggesting that things could have turned out differently?”
The construct shook its avian-head. “What I suggest is that we combine our knowledge and come to a solution for this long-standing problem for everybody,” Silky replied carefully, motioning to the text strapped at Ozendyn’s waist. “You spoke of treatises on Crux infusion. Mo, our talented crafter, has an acute sense for ether. I have experience in leyline manifestation, among other zusagcraft. My Rovers have strength forged in conflicts neither of us can conceive of on an individual basis. You have lived through it all for decades. Our horns are yours, Sentinel.”
Ozendyn blinked, stunned by the indomitable pragmatism of the sage. He looked upon his lyst-burned tattoos and etchings of his sword, lacking the typical sheen they held when properly infused. “The bark, or fruit, of an azoth was the reagent my elders relied upon here in the Barrens. I know of one nearby, but it has been claimed by a rogue addax-spawn that bears none of their usual countenance. Its antlers, alongside the azoth’s harvest, should grant us the necessary components.”
This time, he didn’t stop to wonder if Silky’s Rovers would be up to the task.
