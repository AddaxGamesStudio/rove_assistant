[artwork=The King of Storms]
*Mo pulls themself into as tight a ball as possible. Jeering, screaming–violence in all directions.*
*“Just be small. You are not prey, you are just a rock adrift in the waves. Like Nu taught. Nu… why couldn’t you have stayed small? It’s okay, it’s okay. You’re with me now. I won’t let them take you away from me. I’m sorry.”*
*The bloodthirsty members of the Star Hunter clan charged over the coast without a care for self preservation, bolstered by the opening salvo rendered by their leader, the Eclipse. They had one goal: Kill anybody that crosses their path. All the better should it be their true prey of starlings–more ethereal cores ripe for the harvest.*

Uzem’s body lies still–curled in on itself in pure exhaustion. The Star Hunter party cheers in triumph. With a commanding bark the leading stormcaller pushes his crew aside and steps up to begin harvesting his share of power from the prone addax. His face splits apart in a grin that reaches ear to ear as he prepares a crystal of ether to thrust into Uzem.
Shrieking, screaming–instant violence. The moment the stormcaller’s crystal touches Uzem’s hide, one of the addax’s Crucial conjurations materializes and burns away the human where he stands. In a flash, other facets charge through the sanctum, piercing every Star Hunter they come in contact with. Obliterating each and every one of the depraved humans with the power of the King of Storms fourfold; their bestial companions left with no recourse but to cower in the face of such overwhelming power.
You are content to remain held aloft with your hooks until the carnage subsides. Silky lowers himself to be audible over the raging flames, blustering winds, and rumbling walls. “More good news, more bad news. I think you can already guess as to what I consider the bad news–Uzem’s anima has gathered enough energy to manifest without a host. The good news is this newfound corporeality means you should be able to damage them enough until they reintegrate with Uzem himself. You will… have your work cut out for you on that front.”
True to his word the four aspects of Uzem’s power are doing their utmost to merge back with the comatose addax. Each one trying to leap, charge, or swing their way into Uzem’s body–to little effect. Silky confirms that if the conjurations are dissipated, the energy should return back to the original host properly. 
As each of you descends into the inner sanctum, the manifestations of Uzem’s power collectively regard you with unreadable intent. The winds that carry stress and excitement, the thunder that quakes with stubbornness and pride, the rain that begets sadness and ambition, the lightning that burns with rage and passion. These are the regents that comprise the King of Storms, and you shall be judged on their terms.
