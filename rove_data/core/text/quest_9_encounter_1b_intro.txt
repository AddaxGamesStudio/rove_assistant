[artwork=Final Cut]
*Ozendyn jerks awake, reaching for his blade and scanning his tent for Gargaki’s calming presence. After the Rovers had helped him deal the final blow to Bazhar, the Unsouled Barrens were slowly but surely calming. The roars and desperate howls of its denizens spaced farther and farther apart. Strange things still lurked and slithered throughout but its never-ending haze of hunger and violence had tangibly lessened.*
*So to hear not just a shriek in the night, but one that was identifiably human, set his nerves on edge. A group of bandits had been lurking along the eastern stretch of the Barrens, but surely they hadn’t been so foolish as to tread upon the Barrens in pursuit of some travelers? Ozendyn quietly gathers his supplies and begins his hike towards the source of the sound.*
*It’s not long before he discovers the source of the commotion—a human warrior, distorted and wroth. Ozendyn keeps his distance as he watches the man throw himself along the ground in fits. Blood runs along his head and torso, pouring freely from gleaming crystals impaled through his flesh.*
*The cores left behind by a fell cradle. Raw, twisted ether of desperate monsters flooding in and out of an equally desperate and monstrous individual. Ozendyn shakes his head ruefully and turns back to return to his camp. He would have to warn the young zusag triplets to stay away for a while.*

Travel in and out of the valley surrounding The Seat of Storms is often dangerous, but with Uzem having fled to find respite, getting around the range of mountains is much safer. Or it would be, were your party not speeding through as quickly as possible to chase down the fleeing Star Hunters. Silky has impressed a sudden sense of urgency after briefly following their route.
As you all reach the plateau on the other side of the mountains, your advance is cut short by the sound of screams and howling. When you draw closer, the only sound that remains is the howling—not from a beast, but a human. A lone harrow, surrounded by the carved remains of other Star Hunters, screams his fury skyward as he impales himself with the starling cores collected from their bodies. His figure is grotesque—bloated and churning with barely contained pulses of ether. The beasts scattered throughout the camp snarl, but keep their distance from the man.
Mo recoils from the sight, pressing themselves against Grandpaw’s bulk in an effort to hide. “The vessels. He must have decided the foul things of Navel could grant power. I think they had… other ideas, once they felt the other essences within him.”
The frenzied warrior whirls around to face your group, his attention focused entirely on Grandpaw and Mo. Coated in gore and viscera, gleaming ether cores pulsating within his flesh. He is no different than one of the mindless monstrosities of the Barrens now.
