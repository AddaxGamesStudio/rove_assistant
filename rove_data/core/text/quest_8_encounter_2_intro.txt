*The pain is exquisite, sharp and all-consuming, as though the world itself were tearing him apart and remaking him in the same moment. The starling core sinks deeper, its glow intensifying, and veins of molten ore begin to spread across his skin, tracing the pathways of his body like burning rivers. He gasps, but no sound emerges, for his voice is now but an echo in the cacophony of stone and soil.*
*The ground beneath him trembles, the very landscape shifting in answer to his agony. Stones rise unbidden, forming jagged spires around him. The Star Hunter’s eyes, now glowing with the pure ether of Earth, open to meet the horizon, and he stands—transformed, terrible, transcendent. He raises his hand, and the land obeys; cliffs crumble, roots surge upward from the depths, and the air itself seems heavy with the promise of adamant might.*

The fulgurcaps sway with an uneasy tremor, their sanctity violated by the presence of the Star Hunter. His figure is dark and angular, cloaked in robes that writhe as though woven from soil and stone, and his eyes burn with an unnatural glow—the malevolent gaze of a man who sees the world not as a home, but as a tool to be bent and broken.
Before him lies the remains of the aspect of Uzem, its form now crumbled into a lifeless heap. Its antlers, fractured and dull, glint faintly in the wan light, while beside it, the massive obelisk of ether juts from the fungus, its light pulsing erratically like a dying soul. The human’s lips curl into a smile—thin, cruel, devoid of mercy. His entomans skitter and stalk around him, subdued through raw elemental might. 
He lays one hand upon the carcass, and its remnants begin to glow faintly, the ether within it awakening once more, only to be devoured. The energies of Earth surged up his crystal-ridden arm, lighting the veins in his skin with a sickly brilliance. His body jerks as he absorbs it, his head snapping back with a guttural laugh that echoes through the clearing like the shattering of stone.
Then he throws himself against the ether node, pressing both hands against its jagged surface. A cacophony of sounds fills the air—a chorus of shattering, groaning, and screaming, as the crystal’s light drains into him, flooding his body with adamant power. His laugh deepens, echoing through the reach, a sound so cold and predatory that even his companions recoil.
He intones, “The Thunder Mesa stretches like a scar across the face of our past, a cruel reminder that even the great Addax can wield power with the carelessness of a child crushing a flower. But within it is  left a great wealth of power to be claimed. So, I shall teach Uzem how it feels to have a home turned into a display of strength.”
