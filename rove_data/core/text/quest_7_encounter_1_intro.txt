[artwork=Ozendyn]
*Entry within The Barren Quire from “Earlong,” self-appointed Scribe of The Wake.*
*I once heard a theory that the need for sustenance, the sensation of hunger itself, is a symptom of a lack of fulfilling connections. Nonsense, of course, emotion alone is far from an effective source of energy.*
*But… perhaps there is some merit to the notion that physiology manifests some aspects of psychology. What does that say of an entire stretch of land where everything within hungers endlessly?*

It was bedlam, unrestrained and frenzied. Ozendyn tries his best to keep from being overwhelmed, sprinting between boulders and ruins in a desperate bid to find a moment of reprieve from the oppressive collection of furious monstrosities massing in the Barrens by the hour. A brief sensation of calm washes over him as his coruscopod companion returns from its last meal, quickly slithering its way up his leg and around his body. Gargaki never seems as troubled by the creatures as its human is. Likely because fewer things consider the coruscopod as tempting a meal as they find Ozendyn. The benefits of one’s flesh being suffused with Crux ether, he supposes.
It has only been a few days since Ozendyn spotted the troop of human mages make landfall and begin a focused hike from the outskirts of the Barrens straight towards the Bonespire. Ozendyn has trailed them, relying on his experience surviving the region to remain undetected, but their path across the region has been so brash and violent that his efforts at stealth were all but wasted. Blasts of scouring flame, seizing lightning, and slicing frost halted the offense of every stomaw and vessel that crossed the mages’ line of fire. Their march formed a valley of desolation that led more of their clan to their daily sites of camp. Once their numbers totalled some two dozen or more, their assault on the Bonespire began in earnest.
Ozendyn barely remembers what happened afterwards—except for the running. The clan of crystal-impaled humans had awoken something within the Bonespire, and the entirety of the Unsouled Barrens was attacking back in response. Scores of monstrosities had clawed their way from every corner of the Barrens. It now teems with enraged creatures that seek the death of every last intruder, one way or another.
Loud braying steals Ozendyn’s attention from the stalking monsters slowly gathering outside of his current place of rest. That wasn’t a sound anything of the Unsouled Barrens would produce. Gargaki wobbles in response to the noise as well, perturbed by the unusual sound. Without warning, his sight is overwhelmed by a blinding radiance emanating from a shimmering, avian apparition—a zusag conjuration, if his experience was anything to go on. “Good, we’ve arrived in time. I believe a mutually beneficial arrangement is in order for us both! Spare us both the surprise at hearing my voice though, I doubt we have the time to fuss over the particulars.”
The source of the unusual braying then made itself known as it appeared on the horizon. It was an arkenyn, far from its usual stomping grounds, adorned in a variety of accoutrement and mounted by a pair of people wedged between the boxes and bags. Striding confidently at their side were what Ozendyn could only assume were hired guards, but their auras were far too impressive for simple mercenary work.
The vanquishing of creeping abominations is a straightforward task, one much more to Ozendyn’s preference as opposed to fleeing from a horde. Based on the expressions showing amidst the warriors, it seems they share the sentiment.
