*Each rustle in the spectral gloom,*
*Foretold of tales within the tomb,*
*And shadows danced with twisted grace,*
*As darkened fate worked to interlace.*

Frantic splashes erupt in the midst of the swamp. A bleached skull with three eyes of worry, fear, and regret are cast upon you. The skull clatters and wobbles with uncertainty, as it searches for something within you. Whatever the monster seeks, it is not here, and it proceeds to slam its face into the brackish fluid below. Gurgles and pops echo through the swamp as the fluid fills the hollow spaces of the skull. When it resurfaces, a briarwog is held between its massive beak. A vicious snap rends the creature asunder as its innards are consumed by the grotesque abomination.

The source of the chaos lies here at the heart of the swamp. What was once tihfur is now only scourge, blanketing the region in an endless plume of Morph. There is some hope—the ritual you enacted has had a clear effect on the environment. While the waters of the swamp immediately surrounding the beast are brackish and dark, they take on a more natural green the further away one looks. Even the ever-present nektari seem to have recovered some faint hues of color to their bodies.
Mo nods as they curl their tendrils around themself. “It is as I said. Resonance was the key. The Morph was connecting their bodies; trapping the ether elsewhere has reduced its influence.” Silky quietly congratulates the starling. They depart back towards the marsh where Makaal and Grandpaw remain, leaving you to contend with the ailing heart of the stagnant force.
