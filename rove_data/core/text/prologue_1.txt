*As with any grand formula, change rarely occurs in isolation. An infinite number of variables are affected by an infinite number of dependents. This is why the starlings refer to it as Chorus, after all–it is the many voices that make up the song which has composed our world. I just wish, perhaps, for the volume to… be lowered in intensity. A small note becomes dangerously raucous in the presence of the energies that are weaved through the world. I have heard the rising pitch across the land and fear that I will be unable to ensure it is our part in the performance that withstands the violent crescendos.*
*I have frequently traveled the meridians of Lalos (as any apostle should!). When it comes to the metaphoric richness of a melody I consider our home on this continent to be unmatched. Such a diverse and interesting region of the world we live upon! As of late, each of those journeys now reveal more perils spreading across the lands at an alarming pace. Long ago it was those of us who feared losing ourselves to the savage wilds that sought to establish Rovers as a means of defense against the power struggle between Clans and Crises.*
*Rovers are the powerful individuals from the Clans who have sworn themselves to defend people against the untamed aspects of Chorus as a whole. To Rove is to divide yourself from the interests of one’s Clan in favor of the interests of all. Wielding the energies of Chorus to cleave a path to the future we all desire; each Rover represents a promise to the hopes of all people that yearn for a better life.*
