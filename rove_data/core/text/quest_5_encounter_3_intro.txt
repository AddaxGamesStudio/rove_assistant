[artwork=Kelo & Saras]
*Kelo remembers a day after the conquest of their previous clan by the Ezmen Queens–*
*“Sister, speak of the past clan?” Kelo asked idly. Saras croaked for a moment. “Certain for this?” she prodded. Kelo waved an arm in assent. Saras let out a slightly longer croak this time, gathering her thoughts. “Sandstone was the clan that hatched us. Searing sands with calm winds. Cool shelter beneath the sun with the chambers that the clan created with bricks cast of the sand that carried us. Consider the scales that dress us; so much different than the others of Ezmen clan. This marks us as ilk of the sun and sands. Legacies of the ancestors that survived migration across those dangerous wastes. Scaleless folk even mixed with us! Though… can’t recall much of them.” Saras’ tail drew small pictures in the dust near Kelo, illustrating the single family of humans that had settled with the clan during her own childhood. He found that interesting and wondered what it would have been like to grow with them.*
*“Distantly beneath the sands–places that felt needless for the clan as sandcrafters–was the skara that slumbered, completely concealed. Could have gone countless generations without ever discovering it. The queens came with their clan. They… somehow recognized this, the slumbering skara. That was just after the season’s hatch, with cute little Kelo! Kept this cute mite for myself, called them brother. The parents felt sorry for the solitary skink called Saras.” she laughed, drawing a crude rendition of a tall pair of keb–Kelo’s birth parents. A small rasska jubilantly held up an even smaller keb next to them. He remembered fondly how often Saras would support him with her own body.*
*“The queens shredded the lands so they could expose the tunnels beneath. They found their quarry. Everything else was… incidental. Casualty. Scores of kifa, furious Gruv… The queens saw something with us, kept us safe, took us with them.” Saras shuddered, the twitching of her tail brushing her drawings aside. “Perhaps this was luck. Perhaps, misfortune.”*

Saras looks on at her little brother and feels a swell of pride. While still small for his age, they both know now it was because he hadn’t had the chance to tap into his power. These days he’s shedding and growing constantly—his shell more lustrous with each day. Even now he is busy wielding Morph and bringing every creature in this chamber under his direction. The power of the skara to enhance Morphic communion is truly impressive. If she could match his progress in her own martial training, they would for sure earn the right to be labeled Toll Bearer. Perhaps they would even join Advocate Marii as another escort to Sovereign Femii! Saras isn’t so fond of the idea, but Kelo has his thoughts set on it, and so she will support him. She isn’t certain about the path the clan is taking. Many of her fellow officers have been so thoroughly weaved by Sovereign Femii that they resemble little more than toys she barely remembers from her youth. 
Though… by now she and her brother have worked to further the goals of the clan too much to stop. This is to be their home now, forever more. Her brother and her have their orders. The Rovers can not be allowed to disrupt the clan’s construction. They will be put to the sword—stripped of scale and shell—as any other dissident would.
