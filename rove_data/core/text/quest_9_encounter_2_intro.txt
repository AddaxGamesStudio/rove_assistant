*Mo twists the bar of metal in the furnace thoughtlessly. They weren’t sure how long they had been working. It didn’t matter. Nothing mattered.*
*Another clan member came to deliver the next scratchpad for the crafting requests. A young keb rasska pairing, based on the keb’s nascent Morph ether. They lingered in Mo’s chamber, clearly working up the courage to try and speak.*
*A tendril wrapped itself around Nu’s core unbidden. Mo hadn’t wanted to begin absorbing it, so it was simply kept as close as possible. Another tendril whipped out violently at the young keb rasska and the starling let out their best approximation of a rasska’s warning hiss. The pair startled and dropped the scratchpad as they turned and fled.*
*Guilt churned its way across Mo’s body. The starling walked over and picked up the request and ran a pair of tendrils along its surface. Lockboxes that would withstand long-distance travel on the back of a draught arkenyn, with hidden chambers that could store smaller containers of lyst. An extra note expressed concern about ‘contamination’. Curious, Mo hadn’t met anybody outside of the commune that understood unsorted lyst could leech off of one another and dilute their efficacy.*

Mo thrashes against the metal bars holding them captive. It was surprising that the Star Hunters had managed to infuse the cage with enough Earth ether to stymie the starling’s efforts, but perhaps that was just a lucky coincidence. The ores from the western volcano and the southern desert both would have been rife with such content. How infuriating it was to have managed to barely escape this exact situation before, only for a cruel twist to bring Mo back to another struggle against the obscene humans once more.
“Patience, boys and girls. Two wings with one arrow on this one! We’ll all get our fair share on the next pass once they’ve finished things up north.” Mo’s jailer chortled. He was a spindly branch of a man, but unlike many of the warriors of the clan the starling had seen so far, this one was so very… precise. A Morphic core at the base of the neck to balance the flow of Water and Air from either shoulder. This individual was important enough to receive special attention from the more experienced implanters.
A flash of Crux catches Mo’s attention. Without stopping their assault against the cage, the starling began to focus on the source. Perfect symmetry cut into the shape of a bird—Silky had scouted the camp in record time. Mo didn’t relax, but found themself gently rubbing Nu’s core. 
A vindictive glee was bubbling within the starling’s limbs.
