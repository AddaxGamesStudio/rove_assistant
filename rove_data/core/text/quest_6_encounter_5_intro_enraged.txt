*Over the land a curse was cast,*
*A silent echo from the past,*
*And as the black birds took their flight,*
*They bore away the waning light.*

In the depths of the swamp stands a monstrous ashen avian. Their long tail lashes out into the dark, the sharp feathers along its length casually shredding the brittle flora surrounding it. A pale skull with three eyes of wrath, woe, and despair survey their surroundings. The monster twists its skull unnaturally, adding percussive snapping and popping to the sounds of its screeching Yanshif cohort. 
**“H E A R  M E,**
**L I S T E N  T O  M Y  S O N G.”**
Shrieking tones emanate from the hollow visage of the monster. The collected Yanshif fall one after the other in reverent bows. Miasma flows into each of them, their bodies beginning to swell and their plumage taking on a new sheen of gleaming ebony. Fluttering nektari descend in droves to add their own wingbeats to the undulant dirge.
**“W E  A R E  A H M A,**
**Y O U  A R E  N O T  W E L C O M E!”**
A whirlwind of razor-sharp feathers explodes across the swamp. Every member of the procession screams as their bodies are assaulted by the energy that rends the flesh from their bodies to build upon the creeping cloud. Your only choice now is to fight against the chaos made manifest.
