No Sky Could Blind You Now
The infected silvan assault would be enough to deal with, but with the additional lethality of xulc-possessed tihfur and the monstrous assault of grafted terranape, the site of the ritual is a riot of flying arrows and rending talons.Pressure builds from the Morphic ritual as it reaches a zenith, until it peaks. A cacophony of sensation erupts from the centre of the mystics. 
****What?****
A wave of energy rushes over you, and for a moment the world is unfathomably overstimulating. Smoke emanates from the mystics, who fall to their knees in exhaustion. Infected tihfur both in containment and on the battleground around you let out a scream. Smoke begins to emanate from them too as they leak bubbling grey onto the ground. ****How?**** Twisted talons and bulging mutations undo themselves, fall to the ground as weakened xulc parasites, which are immediately executed by the Yanshif. Around you, tihfur are cured. ****This can’t be.**** Silky runs from his hideout to your side. 
“It worked.” Mo, Makaal and Hra each let out a tremendous cheer, joined by the hoot-like hollers of the remaining Yanshif and the rumbling roars of the wounded Urshif! ****No.****
Silky continues through the cheer, “if the Yanshif mystics were able to do this for their own, they can teach us the principles. Though they did so with their unbound access to Morph. If we find a way to generate enough etheric energy that matches the ether in each of you, we can replicate it. And we can pass on that replication process to others across Lalos.” 
****No. We won’t let you go.**** The xulc parasite speaks to your minds as one, at once. It hurts. ****You are too important to us. We won’t let you leave. We gave you vitality. We can take it away.**** You buckle to the immense pain across your bodies. You can feel the xulc parasite asserting its dominance over you. Throughout you. Silky rushes to your side, but it is the thundering voice of the ether-charged Hra that you hear first. “Worry not.” 
Amidst the jubilance and exhaustion, their voice is illumination itself, it speaks with knowledge of something you don’t have.
“Rest now. Resist the xulc. We move tomorrow,” they command. 
“It’s time.”
