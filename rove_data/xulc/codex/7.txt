It Burst with a Nervous Little Pop
Slaying the monstrous creature is a frenetic task. Though it appears clumsy, it wields its simple hammer with brutal speed and ferocity, more egg sacs spawning, bloating and bursting various xulc parasites in moments as it does. Despite its multiple blows, it shows no sign of weakness or wound. It doesn’t slow, it doesn’t appear fatigued. It is alive and murderous, until it isn’t. One final blow brings it to its knees, and a bubbling, rising tension within its tumorous body swells. Inflating rapidly as though containing a thousand tiny detonations, the ****nidus**** explodes in a plume of vile multichromatic gas, limp, empty legs draping the ground like a drained boil. The gas brings you and your zusag companions to tears, and you do what you can to ignore the fact that your xulc ****loves it.**** 
The wounded Ozendyn and his coruscopod limp over from the shelter they were taking since you joined the fight. “I’m starting to think these zusag haven’t been the only thing keeping tabs on me, Rovers. Though at least you’re more useful in a fight”. The warrior throws a jab at his zusag companions expecting an equal retort, but is greeted with silence as they stand silently around the body of one of their fallen. “Poor thing.” 
Ozendyn continues. “She didn’t even know what was coming. Had no chance to defend herself. This is my fault.” The Sentinel’s tone sobers, as Gargaki stops consuming the corpse of an infected stomaw to comfort him. “They’ve been following me since we felled Bazhar. I finally let them join me, thought I’d give them a chance. Truth be told, it felt good to have a clan again. We went about clearing up remnant stomaw nests until one of ours went missing. That’s how we came across this foul place. A sickness thrives here, and this thing - this ****beautiful**** monster was some kind of midwife to the infection. It was.. studying her. Most foul, Rovers. Most foul.” 
“It’s not your fault, Ozendyn.” One of the zusag pipes up with a wisdom belying her age. 
“This is what a querist is, and a balatronist even more so. Adventure is a risk, and a risk isn’t real if it doesn’t have real consequences. Lurpen would have known that as we all do. At least we have stopped the spread of this bothersome blight, Lurpen gave her life to a worthy cause.” Ozendyn nods thoughtfully at the zusag’s words. A potent reminder that as mischievous as these querists appear, they are still disciples of a zusag school. His solemnity breaks as he turns back to you. “What’s wrong with your skin, Rovers?” 
Looking at your bodies, deep purple veins stretch a sickly web beneath your skin. You can feel the infection worsening, as if inhaling the gas of the nidus has - ****taught me something its let me in I can feel you know I can**** - worsened your condition. Your body twists in shape. You can feel yourself changing. You must finish the tasks Silky assigned to you before returning to him. At least then it’s one less thing to admonish you for after he realizes you failed to tell him about your infection.
