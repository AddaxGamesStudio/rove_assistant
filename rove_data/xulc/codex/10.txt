We’re Leaving
Dispatching the last infected creature, you take a breath. 
“You rack up a mean tally, Rovers. It’s going to be hard to pay you back.” Makaal almost seems to throw the words at you, but they land more like a ball tossed than a knife. 
His playfulness, as persistent as it might be, doesn’t last as long as he’d like. 
“These things… What are they, Rovers?” Mo asks, tendrils dripping in some vague gesture towards sweat. “They are devoid utterly of ether… life without life.” ****Yet are we not alive?**** You do your best to explain, though said explanation involves a lot of shrugging. The merchant and the crafter alike express distress at the news that Silky got hurt, but it soon shifts to a new fear. 
“These parasites. They made it this far from the Unsouled Barrens already? Or maybe they were already here?” Makaal asks.
“Or maybe they just arrived. Like I, and all other starlings do.” Mo responds, blankly. 
At this point, the specifics feel irrelevant. It is simply known that the ****Xulc**** are here, in many places, and they are ravaging and spreading like wildfire. 
The next part doesn’t need to be said. Mo, Makaal, and Grandpaw all move towards you. “Yes, Rovers”, Mo begins. “We’ll accompany you once more, at least until the scope of this threat is understood.” 
“And besides,” Makaal continues, “who’s gonna keep you all on your feet? For a reasonable price, of course.” 
Mo leans down and wraps one their ‘hands’ around the shell of an armored xulc. Assessing it with their many sensory tendrils, they turn and address the Rovers specifically. “I would like to experiment with these creatures in my workshop also, with your permission, Rovers. Their bodies display unusual properties. Even in my hand now I feel the xulc-parts rejecting the ether of my form. There may be valuable tools to be made from these.”
“Or just the ugliest scarves you’ve ever seen,” Makaal adds. 
“That too.” finishes Mo. Grandpaw lets out an affirmative bark.
