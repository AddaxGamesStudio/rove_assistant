Purpose
You help Hra break through the infected silvans to the object of their focus - a single starling crystal, half embedded in a treestump shrine. The starling plucks it free with a tendril, brings it close to their face, and lets out a sound that feels like the grief of the earth. Around you, even despite the shattered xulc bodies, flowers blossom at the sound. 
Hra turns to you, the first time they have done so. The starling, despite the obvious chunks carved out of its form, still stands with a defiant power. “Appreciation, Rovers.” 
The amethyst glow where the starlings ‘eyes’ would be narrow on you. “No. The parasites are in you too. But subdued.” ****Waiting.**** “Weak.” ****No.**** “Unable to take you fully.” 
****Until you let us in.**** Mo and Makaal look at each other with a mixture of relief and concern. “I hate being so right all the time,” Makaal utters under his breath.
Hra moves closer, head first towards you. They are almost intimidatingly close now. You brace for another combat, until they bring their head tall again. 
“I see it now,” Hra rumbles. “My purpose.”
“Come, Rovers. Rove.” ****Disgusting.**** ““We have parasites to extinguish.” ****Why would you want this abomination with you?**** “And Rovers to heal.” ****It won’t work.**** Tired, wounded and frankly afraid, you don’t argue with the starling as it starts to lumber towards the far village of Tuor.
