Crush
Unwilling to create yet another creature to fight, when you destroy the hastadillingâ€™s head, you ensure to smash it until no discernable shape can be seen. As if the remains of the infested host heard your thoughts ****we did****, the parasites themselves erupt from the pulverised skull to attack you.
