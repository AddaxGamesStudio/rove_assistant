Eruption
Attempting to kill this lipidoid monolith is like trying to carve one’s way through a living mountain. The body at the zenith, grotesquely disproportionate compared to the lower slag heap, wields a simple hammer with brutal speed and ferocity. Such a base and primal manner of dealing wounds from such a nightmarish cluster of eggs and death. Every chunk carved off of the creature bloats and bursts it apart, various xulc parasites skittering and flailing out of every wound. You hack, you tear, you pierce, and you enchant until the flesh mound shrinks, disassembled, de-bodied, de-limbed, de-faced, de-stroyed. Fetid gore rains through the air from the brutality you and your allies exact until it causes total system collapse. Inflating rapidly as though containing a thousand tiny detonations, the ****nidus**** explodes in a plume of vile multichromatic gas, flaps of skin and meat floating the ground like pieces of wet tarp. The gas brings you and your companions to tears, and you do what you can to ignore the fact that your xulc ****loves it.**** 
The wounded Ozendyn and his coruscopod limp over from the shelter they were taking since you joined the fight. “I’m starting to think these zusag haven’t been the only thing keeping tabs on me, Rovers. Though at least you’re more useful in a fight”. The warrior throws a jab at his zusag companions expecting an equal retort, but is greeted with silence as they stand silently around the bodies of their fallen. “Poor things.” Ozendyn continues. “This is my fault.” The Sentinel’s tone sobers, as Gargaki stops consuming the corpse of an infected stomaw to comfort him. “They’ve been following me since we felled Bazhar. I finally let them join me, I’d give them a chance. Truth be told, it felt good to have a clan again. We went about clearing up remnant stomaw nests until one of ours went missing. That’s how we came across this foul place. A sickness thrives here, Rovers. Unlike any I’ve seen. This thing - this - ****beautiful resplendent**** - monster was some living incubator for the infection. It wasn’t like this when we got here, it looked more like a…”
“Like a man,” Makaal interrupts?
“Yes,” Ozendyn continues.
“Exactly,” Makaal pipes up, “we’ve seen things like this, back out towards the Thunder Mesa. Infected blessed humans, but nothing on this scale.”
Hra shudders, vines and leaves shaking from their body to the ground. 
“This sickness has spread that far already,” the shock in Ozendyn’s voice is like a ringing bell? “How have none of us heard of this until now?” 
“It appears this contagion has spread fast,” Mo offers, “or has laid dormant for a while, only to make itself known now,” Ozendyn finishes.
He turns to you. “What’s wrong with your skin, Rovers?” 
Looking at your bodies, deep purple veins stretch a sickly web beneath your skin. You can feel the infection worsening, as if inhaling the gas of the nidus cluster has ****taught me something it’s let me in I can feel you know I can**** - worsened your condition. Your body twists in shape. You can feel yourself changing. Mo and Hra both let the ether within them swell. The starling crafter speaks with an unusual certainty: “We must return to Silky now, Rovers. We can delay no longer.”
