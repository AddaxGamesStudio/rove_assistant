If It Bleeds, We Can Kill It
The xulc throws everything it has at you, even that which once was you. It’s strong, but you’re stronger. They mirror your movements, match your strikes with blocks, they know you. They studied you. But they can’t be all of you at once. They begin to slow, even by a fraction of a second, and that’s all you need to exploit the opening. You’re Rovers after all, heroes of your people, and rarely has a being been such a notable threat to all of your people at once.

The water and the dark was our home before your ancestors could talk.”**** The xulc raises themselves out of the water with a lithe, masterful grace that makes their quicksilver movements on land look sluggish in comparison. Their blood still trickles into the water. You know what that means.
