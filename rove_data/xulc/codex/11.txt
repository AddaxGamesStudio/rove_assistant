The Road Yawns
Dispatching the last infected creature, you take a breath. 
“You rack up a mean tally, Rovers. It’s going to be hard to pay you back.” Makaal almost seems to throw the words at you, but they land more like a ball tossed than a knife. 
His playfulness, as persistent as it might be, doesn’t last as long as he’d like as he winces at Mo tightening the sling around his shoulder. Grandpaw lets out a pained wheeze as he licks his wounds. He looks at you with uncertainty.
“These things… What are they, Rovers?” Mo asks, tendrils limp and lifeless. “They are devoid utterly of ether… life without life.” ****Yet are we not alive?**** You do your best to explain, though said explanation involves a lot of shrugging.
“Is that what is wrong with your skin?” Makaal asks. “It almost looks like the same thing that happened to these poor creatures. Are you infected too? Are you going to turn into one of these?” ****Soon.****
An uncertain silence is all you have to offer. Thankfully, it’s enough. The merchant and crafter look at each other with a deep fear, until Mo winces and loses their balance. Hra shifts their weight and catches Mo in their tendrils. The two starlings glow gently for a moment, a process that appears to alleviate Mo’s pain. 
At this point, the specifics feel irrelevant. It is simply known that the ****Xulc**** are here, in many places, and they are ravaging and spreading like wildfire. 
“Take us with you.” Makaal asks in the most assertive voice his young, broken body can muster. “You… I mean we all shouldn’t be alone right now.” 
Mo leans down and wraps one their ‘hands’ around the shell of an armored xulc. Assessing it with their many sensory tendrils, they turn and address the Rovers specifically. “I would like to experiment with these creatures in my workshop also. We need to know how they work. Their bodies display unusual properties. Even in my hand now I feel the xulc-parts rejecting the ether of my form. We may be able to make weapons out of these .”
“Or just the ugliest scarves you’ve ever seen,” Makaal adds. 
“That too,” finishes Mo. Grandpaw lets out an affirmative bark.
