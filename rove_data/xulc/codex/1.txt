Kill it with Fire!
As the light within the beastâ€™s un-soul goes out, the other therans cease their decrepit assault. Out of the shattered corpse of the dying thing before you crawls a foul creature. An ophidian mass of arms unfurls in a silvery grey heap, emitting a moist hiss as if releasing pressure. A long tongue hangs limp from the centre of its twisting astral shape, dripping the crimson meat of its dying host. Barbed hooks bristle down its otherwise featureless limbs in a clicking shudder, signalling something most foul in the bodies of the other infected creatures. The crystalline carapace of urns break apart and flower, revealing a writhing mass of similarly hooked limbs. The chewed bodies of the stomaw take on a wholly different kind of asymmetry as they begin to writhe in a frenzy both ecstatic and alien. Ether itself appears to bend around and recoil the infected monstrosities, as they attack with fresh vigor.
