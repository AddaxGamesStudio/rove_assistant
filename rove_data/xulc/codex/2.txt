[artwork=Stolen Urn]
Riddled Shell
As the infected urn perishes, intricate mutations on its shell become clear. Concentric rings of keratin form in strange but beautiful spheres around shards of dead parasite. The hard stone is the urnâ€™s natural response to the infection in overdrive, but it possesses a strange quality that is able to absorb the ether from nearby crystals. This will probably come in useful.
