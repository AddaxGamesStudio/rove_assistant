[subtitle=Conclusion]
It’s Gone?
****PAIN.**** You disembowel the shadows.
****STOP.**** You burn all the grass from the world.
****Please****
You pull the sky down from its mantle by the throat and crush its skull.
This twisted place, what the xulc parasite had done to your mind and your soul, it’s influence and corruption and hatred and fear. It all bleeds out unceremoniously, a dying animal in a ditch. Silent at last.
Light pierces through. Hra’s Light. All around, across the violet sky, vast constellations appear in concentric triads, the sign of the teacher, the sign of the artisan, the sign of the young prince.
You feel the pulsing of the tihfur ritual, that same kaleidoscopic barrage, but this time all across your being. Muscles unwrap, bones vibrate, saliva and blood effervesce. Color and sound and pulling, a yawning pulling in your guts, a widening out, inversion so comprehensive you fear your organs will spill across the floor, a stretching so far beyond that you are certain your skin will shred and your bones will shatter. Everyone looks like everyone else, looks like you, flowers like oceans like stars like beasts in the sky above, heaven twisting into itself, falling across itself like rain, like blood, like meteors, like all of the things you’ve ever seen or held or wept over laid over each other, glittering, wrapped all around you like silk.
Before your soul breaks under the weight, normality reasserts itself as the ritual completes. The bridal veil of your communion with everything that ever was is let back down by the feeble limits of your mind, and reality quietly re-dresses itself in the prudish gaze of mortal consciousness. 
Hra’s walls are here again. Their floor, their ceiling. Your minds are yours again, the mutations gone, your bodies hale and strong. Like none of this ever happened
On the ground, a handful of xulc parasites wriggle out of Hra’s altar. They seem so weak, those things that stole you. So pathetic. They collapse over each other as they scramble, over and over. They don’t part now, acting as some gelatinous rolling ball. You look at each other, wondering when to intervene. The answer to that question comes, and it is ‘a moment ago’, as the xulc bundle grafts itself and shifts into a new form. A similar form to that of a human or tihfur. It has arms, a head, and it can talk.
****“Thhhhank you… Rovers. You gave us.. Me, all I needed after all.”****
With quicksilver speed, the xulc being disappears out of Hra’s hall.
