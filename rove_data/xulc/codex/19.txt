I Hope This Was Worth It
Packing the last of the living xulc samples into the basket on Grandpaw’s back, the arkenyn growls in protest. “It’s okay big fella” says Makaal as he runs his fingers through Grandpaw’s fur. “They won’t hurt you.” 
Later, at camp, Mo and Makaal are tinkering by the light of one of Silky’s crux conjurations. Their bickering only occasionally cuts through the crackling fire and the mountainous Hra’s grumbling meditation. 
Silky whistles a tune as he fries some herbs and miscellaneous dried entoman he brought from home. Despite his cockiness, the fundamentalist was a fantastic cook. So why does the smell make you all feel so bad? 
****You know why, Rovers. You’re blossoming. Becoming one of us. You crave real sustenance, hot wet meat off of the bone - and then the bone too. Crunching, chew-****
“Tempted to try?” Silky asks. The rumble-gut of nausea answers the zusag for you. 
“Perhaps some new items could take your fancy, Rovers,” Mo beckons.
Mo holds out a number of foul looking items - ****What did they do to us?**** - organs spliced and drained into flasks, blades of hooked xulc teeth and grafted bone, sacs of gas and meat and bone. “We have more ideas in the works, but so far, it appears we can use the xulc’s extreme bioplasticity against them.” ****You’ll be first, crafter.****
You must admit, there is a degree of comfort offered by knowing these things can be dismantled and used. You feel some primitive sense of control, like the first theran to show dominance over its environ through the use of tools. You’ll take what victories you can get.
