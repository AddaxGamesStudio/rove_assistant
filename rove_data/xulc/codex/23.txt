You’re Glowing
With the last crackling strike from above, Hra detonates. Between the crevices of their stone and vine body the constant sparking of lightning erupts out, licks of pure crux charge strike the bodies of the xulc-infected. It all happens in a flash. Burned out corpses fall to the ground, hair and fur stands on end, and a pang of dizziness overwhelms you as the resonant charge temporarily disrupts your nervous systems. Your xulc parasite voice just whines in exhaustion. Where Hra was is now a huge plume of impenetrable smoke.
“Hra?” Silky, now nearly a perfect sphere of charged, puffy fur, throws his question into the smoke. The zusag grabs his Aeiros by the feet and is flown over into the smouldering plume. He conjures some glyph magic, clearing the smoke instantly, and there you see them. 
Hra, resplendent, luminous, even bigger. The stone in their form appears almost glass-like, the plant-life a more vibrant, neon shade of green. ****Foul beast.****
Thus far avoiding the lightning, Mo edges closer to the newly ether-charged Hra. “How… do you feel, Hra?” 
“Ready,” Hra answers with a crackling boom. 
“Ready for what, my luminous luminary?” Silky asks, patting his fur down.
“What comes next,” answers Hra.
