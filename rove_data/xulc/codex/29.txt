Victory!
The xulc dies. No final speech, no further plea for mercy. They try to kill you, they nearly succeed, but you kill them first. Their body sinks into the water for a moment, then rises to the surface face down. It’s done. The waves rise and crash. A pair of scavenger birds circle overhead. 
Over the horizon you can see hundreds of tiny impacts. The xulc are retreating into the ocean in all forms. All over the western coast. 
You stay here until the sun begins to fall. Hacking away at the remaining xulc biostructures from the prime xulc, catching and killing those parasites that pass by you on their mass exodus. What caused them to flee? Will they return? 
You know these are questions that need to be answered, but not right now. Right now, you are cleaners, surrogate custodians of the coastline, purging the living remains of the prime xulc. 
In the weeks after, you’re retiring in Tuor once again, as you were before the xulc invasion. Mo and Makaal are with you this time. Makaal wears a sliver of Hra’s crystal shrine in an amulet around his neck and appears to have a newfound interest in spirituality and rituals. Mo is working on a couple of reports for the Fundamentalists of the Eye School and the Yanshif mystics on their xulc-craft, given the sheer amount of excess biomass the parasites left behind. 
Grandpaw has a newfound anxiety about the ocean, but everyone is working on that. 
Silky has been receiving reports from across the various clans and communities. They’re all much the same - the xulc left one day, many of them leaving behind their hosts in mostly survivable conditions. Many were lost, some entire clans even.
Lalos grieves for what was. But there is also the possibility of something new.
In a week’s time, Silky will hold a conference in New Era for the leaders of many clans across Lalos to discuss the xulc invasion, as well as begin the development of formal mutual aid networks. Representatives from various tihfur, starling, human, and Keb Rasska clans, as well as many zusag school Fundamentalists will all be in attendance. Silky also mentioned some clans and people you have never heard of. This conference will be proof that a future is to be had, if the people of the world can be brave enough to salvage it together. 
Deep beneath the water, the salvaging has already begun.
