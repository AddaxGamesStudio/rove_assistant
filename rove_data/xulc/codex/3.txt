Infected
With the last of the infected monstrosities destroyed, a haunting din falls over the rovers - the realization that Silky hasn’t said a word. The elder zusag merely stands in awe and abject horror of the scene before him, the gentle twitch of his ears the only sign of life he displays. “My ancestors protect me”. Silky’s contemplative appeal to the long-dead is broken by a tremor across the surface of the stagnant waters surrounding you. With a horrifying screech, several of these freshly hatched parasites launch themselves out of the water at each of you. You’re able to bat many of them away by magic or blade, but they keep coming until each of you rovers, heroes all, are lost under a pile of bulbous, undulating nightmares. After a moment that feels like eternity, brilliant light sears through to your vision as Silky stands there, held aloft by ancient glyphs burning through the horrors until they shrivel and burn. Silky collapses to the floor in a heap, etheric energy leaving glittering plumes of smoke from his exhausted form. 
As you rush to his aid, you all notice a throbbing pain. Amidst the many cuts you earned from the mountain of creatures, one pulsates with malign power. A single stem of the parasite digs deep, a kind of proboscis broken clean at the tip. Blue-black malaise attempts to spread as your wound immediately begins to necrotize, but you feel the magic and strong connection to ether you have harnessed over your many adventures holding it back. Looking at each other with concern, the pain turns to power at the source of the pain. This power spreads out across your body in a comforting but unfamiliar warmth and you intuit something far more frightening than the idea of immediate necrosis. The parasite is trying to appeal to you. It even tells you its name.
