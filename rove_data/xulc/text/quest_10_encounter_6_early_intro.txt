*The banging on the door won’t stop. Each clawed fist bangs in a steady, clockwork rhythm. Akaaka notices how the rhythms aren’t symmetrical. Each bangs to its own unique, unrelenting beat, falling in and out of time with each other. The rasska had always appreciated percussion.*
*Learning the akayan drums was always on her to-do list, when she had more time. When the work was done. When she retired. She pictured herself in a circle with her peers and ancestors, lost in a musical frenzy, swaying in time to the syncopated calls and gutturals of her people’s song. She would do so well, she thought. She would impress everyone with the vastness of her soul. She would be one of the rare souls who could stretch across the gamut of science and art and be a paragon of both. If she thought hard enough, she could feel the taut hide beneath her scaled finger-tips as they glanced across the drumskin in slow motion. A voice calls through the drumming in her mind - it was Mirn.*
*Mirn called her companion rasska’s name with her psychic power. With a start, Akaaka turned back to Mirn and the drum-fantasy was ruined.*
*NO TIME, sent Mirn. THEY’LL BREACH SOON. THE RESEARCH MUST BE SAVED. DISTRACTION? HELP?*
*Akaaka looked at her companion keb. The two had accomplished so much together, reaching breakthrough after breakthrough on the parasite infestation that had spread across their land in the recent weeks. But the wolves could no longer be held at the gate. Rumor was, one of the fisherfolk brought one back in their recent haul, and then within days, the entire clan was under siege. They had been holed up in their research hovel for the best part of two days now. Not a wink of sleep.*
*The banging on the door won’t stop. Akaaka appreciated a moment when at least three of the fists fell perfectly into sync, and then out again into a disorganized polyrhythm. She was tapping along on the glass bottle of gruv-fat oil in her hand. The door couldn’t hold much longer. The hinges were splitting. She thumbs through a pouch on her waist, finding the ether-flint.*
*“Distraction,” agreed Akaaka. She got up.*
*CONFUSION. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Mirn sent.*
*“Distracting,” the rasska confirmed. “Got the door?”*
*Mirn nodded, antennae twitching in uncertainty.*
*“Thank you for everything. Learn the drums for me.”*
*Akaaka broke the oil-fat vial above her head with one hand, flicked the ether-flint with another, and threw open one of the doors with a third, and pushed past what was once her ilk with the fourth. The last thing Mirn saw as she hurried to grab the door was a spark of fire ether take her life companion, her best friend, in flames. Akaaka was singing the drum-circle song as she grabbed as many of the parasite-hosts as she could with her flaming limbs, and ran until her legs fell beneath her.*
