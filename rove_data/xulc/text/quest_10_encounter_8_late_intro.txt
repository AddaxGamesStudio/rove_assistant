*Once, when the land had many names, a clan travelled, for travelling was what the clan did best. They moved by cart and by carriage at the behest of their king, a wise and beloved man, who asked of his people but one task - find the place with the “most life”. The clan marched to the endless bogs of the far east and lived amongst the wilds, learning to live amongst the briarwog and march atop stilts. After a year the king, thus far silent atop his palanquin, said “no”. And so the clan travelled on.*
*The clan formed a budding metropolis and lived with other clans, forming complex trade and building meaningful connections. After six months the king, thus far hidden inside his throne room, said “no”. And so the clan travelled on.*
*The clan moved to the south west of the arid desert in search of a vibrant oasis where they could grow trees and swim forever. As the clan travelled - for travelling was what the clan did best, they were beset by a powerful thunderstorm, with the most devastating lightning any of them had ever seen. Forks of lightning the size of the Azoth itself exploded across the path ahead. Thinking they must find another way, the clan set about face, but the king left his carriage and pointed up to the lightning.*
*“There. That is where I want to go. Take me there.” His advisors advised, his warriors worried, but the king was adamant. The clan, afraid to disappoint their beloved king but left with no other choice, refused. And so the king travelled on.*
*The clan watched as their king travelled into the storm, for travelling was what the king did best. Before he was out of sight, the clan saw the king climb the largest rock any of them could see. His elder bones unscuppered by weariness, the silhouette of the king soon found its way to the top. The last the clan heard before the lightning struck the king into ether was the loud echo of one word, “yes”.*

Hra hasn’t spoken many words since you set off to follow them. The fact that you notice this is remarkable in and of itself, because the starling is far from conversational at the best of times. But your giant ally appears determined to make it to the Fulgurite Fields. ****An awful place. You think you can escape us there?****
In fact, if you pay attention, everyone is mostly quiet. Mo and Makaal tinker with the research yielded from the Keb Rasska camp, weaving xulc neural networks into patterned jewels, sewing belt-loops to inflation sacs. Grandpaw seems to always have an eye on you since the xulc asserted it’s dominance after the tihfur ritual. ****Smart beast. It is unwise to take one’s eyes from a predator.****  Silky has been practicing his conjuration and subsequent dismissal of myriad constructs far beyond his usual Aeiros companion. Vertexes, Hyperbola, even lesser seen Labryrites come and go. 
“Call it practice, dear Rovers,” Silky explained. Making use of the Crux at crescendo. It’s true, you could feel the potency of Crux swell as you approached the Fulgurite Fields. ****Turn back. NOW.**** It happened again. You said part of this aloud. Grandpaw lowers his head and lets out a threatening growl. Mo and Makaal grip the hilts of their carving tools, and Silky’s current construct tessellates into a sharper form. You apologise. Hra never stops moving.
“We’re here,” Hra announces. Of all the places that ‘here’ could be, it appears to be a maelstrom of wild etheric energy across giant lodestones, each struck by lightning. You would have preferred ‘here’ to be many other places. “Protect me as I empower myself,” Hra commands as they walk into the tumult of the lodestones.
“From who,” Makaal asks. “Yourself?”
“No,” Hra answers, still walking. “Them”. Their vine tendrils point out a monstrous sight. ****Beautiful.**** A crown, of all things, now infested and possessed by the xulc. ****A fitting title for what is to come.**** What could the xulc achieve with such a power? ****You’ll see.****
