[artwork=Prime Xulc Brood Matron]
*Deep beneath the world, we eat each other. We must. It’s been so long. There is no memory down here. No light. Just the water and the eating. We eat each other down here. That’s all there is. That and the water around us. We think there was once other things to eat. It doesn’t make sense that we would only eat ourselves. But there is no sense anymore.*
*There is some memory, though. Deep in our bodies, passed down, from brood to nest. We remember something that put us here, so, so long ago. We remember we had eyes then. We were large. Something put us here, so deep and so dark. And now we swim, we breed, we remember, we eat. We don’t sleep. We don’t talk. There are no stories, no families. We remember enough, cruelly, to know what those concepts are. But there are none.*
*Time passes. So much time, more time than there ever was before we were here. We’re even smaller now.*
*The world breaks. Something new. Space above. Scent. A new kind of water. We swim out. Others are here. They’re not like us. We’re so hungry.*
*As we eat them, we experience old things. Things from before. Color, scent, feeling. Memory. Their minds, so simple. We eat those instead. When we do, we get to keep the old things. They’re ours now. More things come through. Even new things.*
*More than we ever knew. We know heat now, because there’s more than the cold. We know comfort now, because there’s more than the dark. We know each other now, because we’re more than just food.*
*There’s a whole other life out there.*

The campfire flame flickers. Its warmth is comforting, and for the first time since the xulc parasite infested you, you sweat. You forgot how refreshing it is. The little treasures and quirks of the body, once nullified by the creature hijacking your nervous system. The shivers quelled for you all around an hour ago, the hangover of a body readjusting to the shock of sole control. 
Mourning has a way of making the air feel strange. Confrontational in its passivity. How dare it so gently enter your lungs, yet deny this kindness to ones you love so much? They’re just over there. It could if it wanted to. But it doesn’t. And yet you must. Whom would it serve if you didn’t? One big, spiteful expletive at the wind for being so selective? It might feel good for a second, a violent, gritted-teeth second, but that feeling would soon turn to powerlessness when you gasp for your own breath. 
So you do breathe the air. You’ll make sure not to enjoy it, though.
You’re not sure if Hra breathed air anyway, but that’s beside the point.
The loss of Hra seems to hit Makaal the most, strangely. You’re not sure you saw the two ever really have a conversation on your short but intense journey together. Perhaps he’s touched by a being seemingly reaching their apex only to sacrifice themselves. Perhaps it’s just the first thing he’s lost.
After the xulc left your body and formed something… new, it escaped in the direction of the western shoreline. Grandpaw has been following its trail, but you’ve had to move slowly as you recover from the sickness that set in soon after you left the shrine of Hra. Mo and Silky have been occupied brewing stamina draughts, which they assure will get you on your feet by the time you close in on the trail in the early morning. Now, to rest.
Morning arrives, the campsite packed up onto Grandpaw’s back and your hunt nears its conclusion. Webs of xulc growth starts to appear underfoot, crawling slowly across the stone leading down towards the coast. They grow into thick roots, consuming and absorbing nearby plantlife and silvans into its mass. The roots all converge on a pulsating, embryonic structure embedded within the coastal cliff-face. Inside the transparent sac, you see the xulc-thing that formed from your parasites sleeping. Nesting. 
Without the creature inside moving, it seems to notice you. Tendrils spiral out from the pupa, and launch to attack you. Other xulc parasites emerge from the mass of pods. 
**This is where it ends.**
