*Gargaki slithered up Ozendyn’s leg and onto his chest, letting out a low gargled pur of comfort. Ozeyndyn’ looked down at the coruscopod and grunted. “Leave it alone will you. I do not need your sympathies.” The old warrior’s companion animal let out a defiant sound as it trailed back down next to its master’s rollbed in a huff. The corsucopod had spent many an evening attempting to comfort its master since the collapse of the bonespire, but Ozendyn refused to allow himself the respite. Not because it wasn’t wanted, but because it was awfully unfamiliar. After Bazhar’s destruction, Ozendyn was no longer the last, defiant warrior of his clan. The last remaining Sentinel of the Wake. No, he was just Ozendyn, a warrior with no war. A sentinel with no charge. He was just a man, now, and few fates are less reassuring.*
*A familiar snicker echoed beyond the light of Ozendyn’s campfire. “By my father’s blade, won’t you give it a rest?!” the man shouted into the darkness. “Nobody’s here!” answered the voice of a young zusag, followed immediately by a smattering of giggles from similar voices. “Then with whom do I bicker, night after night?” Ozendyn replied tiredly. “The wind!” a second zusag answered. “Yeah, from your backside!” offered a third. All around Ozendyn, the youthful sneering of the balatronists following him smothered the quiet night in laughter. Whether from exhaustion or boredom, Ozendyn found the corner of his lip turning upwards. “Just a man”, he thought. “But not alone.”*

You return to the area that you left Silky after that first encounter with the xulc, but how different things are now. It should feel better. You know it should. Mo and Makaal are with you, riding Grandpaw and bickering. The majestic form of Hra gently shakes the earth with each of their giant footsteps. You’re a party again, a historic band of Rovers and their myriad allies. But it doesn’t feel better. It feels more familiar, sure, but that feeling of familiarity is sabotaged by the throbbing of your xulc-wound. You feel the beckoning voice of the parasite in the back of your mind, and you know your fellow Rovers feel the same. It is not synchronised, no - the xulc ‘voices’ do not speak in unison. Each of you are fighting your own individual battle with an individual parasite, hoping you individually can survive its biological onslaught long enough to find a way to kill it. Following Silky’s initial directions to his band of zusag informants, you hear the screams of combat and clashes of steel on the horizon. An unimaginable stench radiates with such thickness, such airborne viscosity that it’s as if you’re underwater in a sea of pure fecundity. Before you is a stomaw nest - or at least what was one, however in its place is a living mound of bulbous, steaming flesh. A pillar of fat bubbles like boiling oil, peaked by what appears to be the metastasized torso of a humanoid, facial features rendered neutral by silvered grey folds of growth. Its entire body - if you can stretch that word’s definition enough to call it that - is rotten with vibrant green eggsacs. 
All across this mound, these eggs roil and pulsate and quiver, birthing slime-covered xulc that fall helplessly into the water below, then spring into violent life. Around this - glorious profound advancement - is a band of zusag fending off the swarm of xulc and mutated stomaw.
