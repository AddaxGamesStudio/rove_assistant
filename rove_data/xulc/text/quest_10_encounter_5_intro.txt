[artwork=Hastadilling]
*The entoman’s wings twitched as it injected its proboscis into the silvan’s ovary. Paralysing saliva trickles out from the entoman’s inner glands, down the long, barbed mouthpiece and out into the phloem, deadening the silvan’s senses before it has a chance to react. After the entoman had secured its meal, it clicked a hydraulic chitin lever in its mouthpiece and expelled residual air, creating a tight vacuum and drawing in the silvan’s minerals into its stomach.*
*The briarwog watched the entoman fall into its feeding-daze, and let out the long elastic muscle in its mouth. The tongue fired out and unrolled like a coiled whip, wet adhesive mucus crushing the entoman’s frail body into the silvan it was eating, before pulling it into the briarwog’s mouth. Thin carapace cracked and split under the tension of the theran’s lips, spilling the silvan meal it was consuming out of its leaking body. With a neutral, asynchronous blink, the briarwog felt but a moment of satisfaction as the tiny life dissolved in its stomach acid.*
*And then it felt nothing.*
*It caught a smell on the wind. Another entoman. The briarwog turned its body slightly, and leapt towards its next meal.*

Only another couple of days of marching before you reach the mountain village of Tuor once again to meet Silky. The pace you’ve been marching at has been at the precipice of a walk and a run, and you decide you need to rest. Things have been tense amongst you all, there’s no doubt about it. The sense that this threat is deeply unfamiliar cannot be shaken, and as the blue-black tint spreads under your flesh, even you are worried - ****fear will soon be gone we feel no fear and soon neither will you**** - about what the future holds for you.
You decide to find a suitable clearing with shelter to set up camp for the night. Hacking through a thick curtain of vines, you are taken aback by how still it is when you see it. Enormous and powerful as they are, hastadilling are uncharacteristically skittish creatures, even to the point where the name is thrown as a playful insult to a soldier that doesn’t quite seem to have the mettle for war. But this one stands before you all, its many eyes as wide as they can be. This hastadilling is riddled ****sublime**** with xulc, more than you’ve seen on any infected creature thus far, even the nidus. 
It stands before you, silent, impossibly still, expressionless, staring. Grandpaw whimpers as quiet as he can, and - unmoving - the infested hastadilling lets out a horrible sound. It sounds like the beast is trying to kill itself with its own scream, a rising cacophony of phlegm and chunked vocal chords spitting into the air. The swarm of parasites ripple beneath its skin, seemingly shutting the nerve centre to its brain down, halting the deathhowl. It bounds at you, head lolling from side to side, wings dragging behind, clawed feet tripping over each other. It is chaos and death ****and inevitable.****
