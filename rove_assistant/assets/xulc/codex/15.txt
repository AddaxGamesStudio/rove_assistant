Separate But Whole
Now fending off the decapitated bulk of the hastadilling, your blows cripple the giant body faster than the xulc inside can graft-heal it. It responds to this pressure by doing something you wouldn’t have expected; it sheds the most broken of the hastadilling’s limbs entirely. Xulc flesh melds and flows into pseudo limbs to replace them- the xulc isn’t just possessing the remains of this poor creature now, it’s supplanting it. ****Improving it.****
