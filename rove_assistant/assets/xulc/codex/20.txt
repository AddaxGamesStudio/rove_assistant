Recycled Parts
Packing the last of the living xulc samples into the basket on Grandpaw’s back, the arkenyn growls in protest. “It’s okay big fella” says Makaal as he runs his fingers through Grandpaw’s fur. “They won’t hurt you.” You aren’t entirely sure who Makaal is referring to.
Later, at camp, Mo and Makaal are tinkering by the light of Hra’s innate fulgurations. The starling is swelling in power by the day, as if the crux within them is reaching a kind of critical level. You wonder who will break first - you or the starling, and what would happen when either of you do.
Silky whistles a tune as he fries some herbs and misc dried entoman he brought from home. Despite his cockiness, the fundamentalist was a fantastic cook. So why did the smell make you all feel so nauseous?
****You know why, Rovers. You’re blossoming. Becoming one of us. You crave real sustenance, hot wet meat off of the bone - and then the bone too. Crunching, chew-****
“Tempted to try?” Silky asks. ****NO.**** You didn’t mean to shout that aloud. But you did.
Silence hangs, save for the crackling of the food in the pan. They fear you as much as they feel sorry for you. ****Let them.****
“Perhaps some new items could help… ease your temperaments, Rovers,” Mo beckons.
Mo holds out a number of foul looking items - ****What did they do to us?**** - organs spliced and drained into flasks, blades of hooked xulc teeth and grafted bone, sacs of gas and meat and bone. “We have more ideas in the works, but so far, it appears we can use the xulc’s extreme bioplasticity against them.” ****You’ll be first, crafter.****
You must admit, there is a degree of comfort offered by knowing these things can be dismantled and used. As you feel them surging through your system - ****we are your system now**** - you feel some primitive sense of control, like the first theran to show dominance over its environ through the use of tools. You’ll take what victories you can get. The surface of the sand shimmers as Hra stands.
“We move tomorrow.” they command. “It’s time.”
