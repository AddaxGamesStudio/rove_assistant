Let’s Move Big Guy
You help Hra break through the infected silvans to the object of their focus - a single starling crystal, half embedded in a treestump shrine. The starling plucks it free with a tendril, brings it close to their face, and lets out a sound that feels like the grief of the earth. Around you, even despite the shattered xulc bodies, flowers blossom at the sound. 
Hra turns to you, the first time they have done so. You’ve just fought side-by-side, an experience that inevitably creates a unique kind of bond, but to have the hulking starling appraise you directly with their resplendent violet ‘eyes’ yields only a feeling of humility.
“I see it now,” Hra rumbles. “My purpose.”
“Come, Rovers. Rove. We have parasites to extinguish.” You move to tell Hra that the journey ahead may be difficult and long, but the starling simply extends a tendril to each of you, a small blue flower in each. There are most certainly worse ways to make companions.
