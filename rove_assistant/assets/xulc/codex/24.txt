Apocalypse Conduit
With the last crackling strike from above, Hra detonates. Between the crevices of their stone and vine body the constant sparking of lightning erupts out, licks of pure crux charge strike the bodies of the xulc-infected. It all happens in a flash. Burned out corpses fall to the ground, hair and fur stands on end, and a pang of dizziness overwhelms you as the resonant charge temporarily disrupts your nervous systems. Where Hra was is now a huge plume of impenetrable smoke.
****A vile thing! A terrible thing!**** The xulc speaks aloud through you again. Bile rises in your throat as your increasingly mutated form shudders in the presence of such ether, and at least one of you falls to the ground in the agony of the atmosphere.
Silky has no clue whom to attend to first - the smoke cloud that was Hra, or the clear pain you’re all in. Hra answers for you. In a secondary discharge of lightning, the smoke burns away.
Hra, resplendent, luminous, even bigger. ****What a horrid monster.**** The stone in their form appears almost glass-like, the plant-life a more vibrant, neon shade of green. ****Kill it. Kill it now.****
Thus far avoiding the lightning, Mo edges closer to the newly ether-charged Hra, being sure to move around your agonized forms, though the pain begins to shift.
“How… do you feel, Hra?” 
The water ether in Mo’s body gently bubbles in the presence of the lightning, adding a subtle vibrato to their question.
“Ready,” Hra answers with a crackling boom. Hra moves towards you - ****KILL IT STOP IT N**** - and a sharp pain takes over. The xulc voice rages, but then is muffled, suppressed by Hra’s immediate proximity. With that, the pain subsides. A moment of genuine, though temporary, relief. 
“Ready for what, my luminous luminary?” Silky asks, patting his fur down.
“What comes next,” answers Hra.
