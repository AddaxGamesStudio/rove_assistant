Until It is Done
“I, uh… I think it’s dead. You can probably stop now.” 
There is no small hint of fear in Makaal’s voice as he shouts over to you, but you each throw one last blow into the wet hastadilling paste to be sure. Killing this thing did not require strength or brute force - but technique. It was not murder, it was surgery. Forceful, terrified surgery. 
This was unlike anything you’d seen before. ****Wasn’t it wonderful?**** No. It wasn’t. You aren’t sure if you said that aloud or not, and you don’t wish to look up to the faces of the other non-infected to check. It was vile. An entire colony of xulc using a poor creature like it was base material to reshape and reform to their desire. Your head still rings from that thing’s scream. ****We are not just cohabitors. Rover.**** You shiver as it cockily calls you by your title, like it’s showing you how fast it’s learning. ****We are evolution. We are perfection. We are**** - “Silence!”
You’re absolutely certain you said this aloud. You all did. ****Let us show you.****
The xulc show you. 
Skin breaks. Hair and fur mats and grows sticky. Limbs and wings and organs that don’t belong to you begin to mutate out of your body. Theran parts, entoman parts, silvan parts. It would feel like a hallucination if it didn’t feel so real. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just sensitive, like new skin under a blister. Hra moves to protect Mo and Makaal, who are screaming. You can’t make out their screams beneath your own. For the first time, the grey xulc flesh is visible atop, between, intermingled with your own.
****This is how good it feels. We will shape ourselves together. To newer, more powerful things. You just have to submit. We’re so close now.****
A smash of glass. Blackout.
