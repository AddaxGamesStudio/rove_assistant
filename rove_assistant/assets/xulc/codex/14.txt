Not One, But Two
This nightmare feels impossible to bring down, a body piloted by an entire colony of parasites, but you hack at its flesh regardless. Hacking and cutting, sending projectiles of steel and ether, the flesh around the base of its neck begins to tear. With one powerful blow, you rend the head from its body, taking the wings at its shoulders with it. 
The smell is putrid, but the headless body doesnâ€™t fall to the ground. Instead, the star-like arms of the xulc inside flail from the wound, hooking into each other, grafting themselves into a terrible flower of grey meat. Hundreds of little xulc limbs scrabble out from the base of the severed head, twitching the vibrant wings into some senseless motion in the air. You have a distinct, vile notion that you have not killed one creature here, but created two.
