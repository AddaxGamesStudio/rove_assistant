Everything Executioner
You ruin the clusters around the prime xulc’s hive, and it can no longer clot any wound you deal it faster than you can deal another. Something like a scream emanates out from the gelatinous chrysalis, a stream of bubbles rising as your next blow pierces the giant cell-wall and the embryonic fluid drains onto the beach. 
Untangling itself like a swarm of snakes, the prime xulc leaps out between you all. It rises high, - it’s grown since you saw it last, looking increasingly humanoid. 
****“Why won’t you let us live!”**** It roars with a throat full of bile.
Silky answers from a zusagart, conjured glyphs scattering the sound around like a multi-tonal chorus of woodblocks, “because, new thing, such a privilege requires mutuality. Permission to survive was not a kindness your kind granted to the rest of us.” 
****“New thing… you have little clue, zusag,”**** the xulc spits. Its body continues to uncurl. 
****“Though I suppose in a sense you’re correct. An aspect of us is new. Consciousness… intelligence - rushed into us in a matter of hours. Base impulse, only the water and the dark… to everything else in sheer moments. The knowledge that there was more to experience, if we found a…host that we could convince to allow us to. But now, what you have given, the power of you Rovers, is far more than we could have wanted, in all our days of living.”****
The xulc undulates and reforms, moving its serpentine form into the shapes and forms of the many mutations that once plagued your bodies. ****“We carry you all within us now. Your powers, your strength, your minds… Thank you, Rovers. It has been a gift. I’m sorry things must end this way.”****
The prime xulc reshapes some of its many arms into a giant blade of cartilage and brings it around, an executioner that feels authentic regret for the task ahead.
