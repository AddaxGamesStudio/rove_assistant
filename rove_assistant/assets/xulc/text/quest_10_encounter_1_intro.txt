*Transcribed musings from “Silky”, resident Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*Peace… peace my prized pupils is the ghost of hope. It is an echo in a bottle, a sculpture of Crux. Peace is a thought that holds such weight, such promise, but by definition dies the moment it is recognised for what it is. Peace is the absence of life, it is the denial of potential. Peace is inert, sterile, it leaves no space for hurt, yearning, hunger. It leaves no space for evolution. And even then, dear disciple, those passing times where peace is felt, how long does it last? Does not the larval galeaper feel peace when it escapes the hungry briarbull, only then to fear the lurching, searching tendrils of the urn? Does not the craftsman feel peace as he finishes a project, only to be demanded to return to the lathe by necessity or ingenuity? No, peace is a terrible thing to spend much time striving for, a whisper to the wind. And even the most morphean of morphics knows Chorus’s everchanging song leaves little room for whispers.*

It feels strange to be travelling together again after all you’ve been through. No sibling-like banter between Mo and Makaal, no rumbling vibrato from Grandpaw’s comforting grumble. No falling sky to avert or despotic warlords to thwart. Silky and his Aerios do their best to fill the notable silence with verbose pontification and impressive aerial gymnastics respectively, but strange it still feels. It reminds you of when you first came together at Silky’s request, a time of curiosity and the unknown. In many ways you are unrecognisable as the Rovers you were then, now apexes of your kind, carrying scars and wisdom in abundance. However there is a certain resonance with the experience you had all that time ago, and in that resonance you feel youthful again. It feels strange to be travelling together after all you’ve been through. But it does feel kind of nice. That is, until you remember where you’re going. 
The Unsouled Barrens remain as nightmarish as the last time you visited. The stagnant pressure in the air, the tingle of your fight or flight response as if the ground beneath you was waiting for the perfect moment to swallow you whole. Though the wasteland has receded, it still feels like predatory oblivion. “I truly would have thought this place would be smaller by now.” Silky states, an unusual edge in his voice. “But we’re nearly where my report identified as the hub of activity.” With a luminous gesture of his claws, Silky’s Aerios soars onward, beyond the large column of jagged rock blocking your eventual path. The wet gnashing of broken teeth and slick licks of pseudopods heralded the all too familiar presence of stomaw ahead, but turning the corner directly reveals an unexpected scene. The stomaw and urns here appear… sick. Not the kind of sickness spawned by Bazhar’s foul fleshcraft, something far… stranger. A rotten pang of pestilence covers the tongues of those among you who have them, and the therans themselves appear uneasy, nauseous and aimless. “What in the five schools…” utters Silky, the buoyant lilt in his voice gone. The sickness here is unlike any you’ve seen in all of your roving. It’s best to put these creatures out of their misery, lest the infection spread.
