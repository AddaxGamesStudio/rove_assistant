*Once, when the land had many names, a clan travelled, for travelling was what the clan did best. They moved by cart and by carriage at the behest of their king, a wise and beloved man, who asked of his people but one task - find the place with the “most life”. The clan marched to the endless bogs of the far east and lived amongst the wilds, learning to live amongst the briarwog and march atop stilts. After a year the king, thus far silent atop his palanquin, said “no”. And so the clan travelled on.*
*The clan formed a budding metropolis and lived with other clans, forming complex trade and building meaningful connections. After six months the king, thus far hidden inside his throne room, said “no”. And so the clan travelled on.*
*The clan moved to the south west of the arid desert in search of a vibrant oasis where they could grow trees and swim forever. As the clan travelled - for travelling was what the clan did best, they were beset by a powerful thunderstorm, with the most devastating lightning any of them had ever seen. Forks of lightning the size of the Azoth itself exploded across the path ahead. Thinking they must find another way, the clan set about face, but the king left his carriage and pointed up to the lightning.*
*“There. That is where I want to go. Take me there.” His advisors advised, his warriors worried, but the king was adamant. The clan, afraid to disappoint their beloved king but left with no other choice, refused. And so the king travelled on.*
*The clan watched as their king travelled into the storm, for travelling was what the king did best. Before he was out of sight, the clan saw the king climb the largest rock any of them could see. His elder bones unscuppered by weariness, the silhouette of the king soon found its way to the top. The last the clan heard before the lightning struck the king into ether was the loud echo of one word, “yes”.*

Hra hasn’t spoken many words since you set off to follow them. The fact that you notice this is remarkable in and of itself, because the starling is far from conversational at the best of times. But your giant ally appears determined to make it to the Fulgurite Fields. ****An awful place. You think you can escape us there?**** Mo and Makaal seem back at home in the Thunder Mesa, but Silky appears distracted. It’s highly uncommon to see the zusag without his Aeiros, but thus far his journey has been consumed by the conjuration and subsequent dismissal of other constructs too. Vertexes, Hyperbola, even lesser seen Labryrites come and go. 
“Call it practice, dear Rovers,” Silky explained, making use of the Crux at crescendo.” It’s true, you could feel the potency of Crux swell as you approached the Fulgurite Fields. ****Turn back.**** You and your fellow Rovers feel the gentle twinge of the parasites within you threaten you, but are sure to hide it from your companies. Lightning storms strike with a ferocity and tempo that you haven’t seen since you confronted Uzem. 
“Or distraction,” Makaal couldn’t help but throw in a jibe. 
“And what would be so wrong with distraction, young folk? The world is dying. An insidious enemy, beyond reason or conversation, infiltrates the fabric of our reality in the name of greed, manipulation and selfishness. A little creative distraction without shame feels warranted, no?” ****Greed? Do you not see all that we offer?****
Makaal has a tear in his eye. Mo puts a hand on their merchant allies shoulder and flutters their tendrils in a harmony of humor and deep empathy. It’s good to be reminded of the zusag’s wisdom from time to time. 
“We’re here,” Hra announces. Of all the places that ‘here’ could be, it appears to be a maelstrom of wild etheric energy across giant lodestones, each struck by lightning. You would have preferred ‘here’ to be many other places. “Protect me as I empower myself,” Hra commands as they walk into the tumult of the lodestones. 
“From who,” Makaal asks. “Yourself?”
“No,” Hra answers, still walking, “them”. Their vine tendrils point out to the surrounding ambush of infected human, tihfur and rasska in the distance the way you came. Had they been trailing us?
