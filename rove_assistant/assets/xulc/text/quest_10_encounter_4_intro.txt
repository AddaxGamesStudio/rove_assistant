*“Let’s not have a repeat of last night please, little ones.” Permea offered the warning gently as she pulled the blanket over her younger siblings, but the warning held no water. She knew how hard it was for them as it came upon the anniversary of their mother’s passing. She knew because she felt it too.*
*“Come on Perrrrm.” Olivon made sure to draw out his big sister’s name. “One more story.”*
*“Yeah! Come on Perrrrm” Mehandra echoed her twin.*
*Permea was tired. It had been a long day at the market, and all she wanted was her own space to rest and escape. Looking at the two babes, both barely 9 summers old, she heard her mother’s voice and agreed.*
*“Ok, my flowers. One more. Did mother ever tell you the story of the living mountain?”*
*The twins shook their heads in unison, bringing the blanket up to place it gently on their lips for comfort.*
*“One day, she was out Roving. A clan of tihfur reported a thunderous noise in the night that kept many of them up, and thinking it was the King of Storms, were afraid to investigate themselves.*
*Mother searched for the source of the noise until she found it; a hulking great starling of the most potent Earthen ether, stone and granite and mud and moss, stomping the ground in distress. They were a quadruped - that means they had four legs, like an arkenyn or a grovetender, with a taaaaall neck like a galeaper.*
*‘Hello!’ mother shouted, ‘Are you ok? Do you need help?’ But you see, this starling wasn’t like others - it hadn’t grown amongst other folk and so didn’t really know what to make of it.”*
*Permea did her best low, grumbly voice. “‘Yes’, the starling responded. ‘Can you tell me why I’m here? What my purpose is?’ *
*Now, mother had not a clue how to respond. ‘I’ll let you know when I figure that out for myself, starling.’ she joked. ‘So you don’t know?’ the starling asked again, and mother just shook her head. The starling whipped its tendrils around in sadness and marched in the opposite direction to mother, despite her calling after them. She told me that she went back to look for that starling every day for the next week, but couldn’t find a trace of the living mountain, but last I checked, she thinks they’re still out there, looking for their purpose. The end.”*
*“Wait wait, that’s the end? Olivon protested. “So mother wasn’t able to help, and it’s just out there now?”*
*“That makes me feel sad.” Mehandra offered. “What was the point of that story Perm?”*
*“The point, little ones.” Permea looked out into the Mesa beyond, a flash of light illuminating the mountainous horizon. “The point is honesty. Sometimes stories are just sad.” Permea turned back at her two siblings with tearful eyes and real, generous love.*
*“But don’t sad stories deserve to be told too?”*
