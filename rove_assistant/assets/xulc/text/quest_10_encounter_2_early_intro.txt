*Gargaki slithered up Ozendyn’s leg and onto his chest, letting out a low gargled pur of comfort. Ozeyndyn’ looked down at the coruscopod and grunted. “Leave it alone will you. I do not need your sympathies.” The old warrior’s companion animal let out a defiant sound as it trailed back down next to its master’s rollbed in a huff. The corsucopod had spent many an evening attempting to comfort its master since the collapse of the bonespire, but Ozendyn refused to allow himself the respite. Not because it wasn’t wanted, but because it was awfully unfamiliar. After Bazhar’s destruction, Ozendyn was no longer the last, defiant warrior of his clan. The last remaining Sentinel of the Wake. No, he was just Ozendyn, a warrior with no war. A sentinel with no charge. He was just a man, now, and few fates are less reassuring.*
*A familiar snicker echoed beyond the light of Ozendyn’s campfire. “By my father’s blade, won’t you give it a rest?!” the man shouted into the darkness. “Nobody’s here!” answered the voice of a young zusag, followed immediately by a smattering of giggles from similar voices. “Then with whom do I bicker, night after night?” Ozendyn replied tiredly. “The wind!” a second zusag answered. “Yeah, from your backside!” offered a third. All around Ozendyn, the youthful sneering of the balatronists following him smothered the quiet night in laughter. Whether from exhaustion or boredom, Ozendyn found the corner of his lip turning upwards. “Just a man”, he thought. “But not alone.”*

Following Silky’s guidance you search for a small warren to the east of your campsite. It takes the better part of an afternoon, a trip mostly undertaken in pensive silence as your throbbing xulc-wound pangs. You feel the beckoning voice of the parasite in the back of your mind, and you know your allies feel the same. It is not synchronised, no - the xulc ‘voices’ do not speak in unison. Each of you are fighting your own individual battle with an individual parasite, hoping you individually can survive its biological onslaught long enough to find a way to kill it.
You are happy for the tension to be broken by the familiar rotten pang of pestilence, a scent of iron, dirt, and meat. A call to action. Following the source of the stench to a nearby stomaw nest, you see yet another unexpected and unwelcome sight. A tall, hulking humanoid festooned in vibrant green eggsacs, swinging a simple club lazily at an ensemble of zusag. The eggs on its back pulsate and quiver, birthing slime-covered xulc that fall helplessly into the water below, then springing into violent life.
