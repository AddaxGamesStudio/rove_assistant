There is nothing. Only warm, primordial blackness. No xulc parasites are contained within it. ****Are you sure?****
You awake to an absence of light. Hands, legs immobile. You’re sat down, tied up. You make a muffled sound, and daylight overwhelms your senses as the bags over your heads are taken off. Mo backs off quickly to join Makaal and Silky. You’re in a place you don’t recognize, it appears like an outhouse or a wooden shed. How long have you been out? 
Makaal stutters as he talks. “D-don't try anything! There’s plenty more of where that came from.” He holds a vial of gas in his hand - that explains the knockout. 
“There’s no need for that, my boy.” Silky pipes up with a grave tone.
“You are still yourselves, Rovers?” This isn’t so much of a question aimed at you, but at reason itself. 
“How do you feel?” ****Tell them. Tell them how good you feel.****
You talk, some of you with new voices, mostly about how much Makaal’s toxin hurts your head. Silky seems relieved. Mo edges closer, - ****stop him**** - the ether of their body a low burn to your increasingly xulc-infested bodies. “They are themselves, still.” Mo offers, Makaal lowers the potion in his hand - thankfully too, because he’d probably knock everyone in the building out if he threw it at this distance. 
Silky strokes his antlers. “It appears the amount of etheric magic in your veins is keeping the xulc parasite from being able to take you over, for now at least. Mo and I have designed a tincture to help continue to keep it at bay, - ****they will try**** - but it’s no permanent fix. No permanent fix. 
“As for the rest of Lalos, dear Rovers….” You can tell the zusag is forcing the term, but resolve to accept it in light of the circumstances. ”Much of the continent has been affected. Wherever these xulc have come from - ****beneath, above, between**** -  they’ve come here fast. In such a short time we’ve seen them corrupt ****bless**** savannah therans, mountainous silvans, and monstrous unsouled alike.”
Silky’s foot anxiously thumps the ground. “We’ve seen at least one corrupted ascended humanoid acting as a living birthing chamber, and now we’ve seen almost the entire contents of a birthing chamber work together to twist and sculpt a powerful creature like a hastadilling like clay. It doesn’t matter the environ, it doesn’t matter the biology, the xulc appear to be able to pilot, corrupt, reform and hybridize with all manner of life on Lalos - except for the starlings - and you, for now.”
Silky sits, letting out a small wince as he does - he’s still weak, it would seem. It hurts to see him like this. ****We could help.****
“We need you, Rovers. Perhaps more than ever. Many communities are keeping this blight at bay, but at this advanced speed, none can sustain their defense in perpetuity. Not unless we learn more. My Eyes and Ears have reported a few leads. 
Down towards the Thunder Mesa, a Keb Rasska tribe has been gathering samples of the xulc for study. It appears they had found a way to make use of the unique traits of the xulc to synthesize ointments and boons that are effective against their own kind. Mo is optimistic they can build on this study to aid our quest. 
Meanwhile in Taharik, the tihfur have demonstrated a novel resistance to the xulc’s infestation. Not like the starlings, who reject the infestation on a physical level, but the tihfur have found a certain spiritual resistance through ritualistic manipulation of morph. If their rituals can be perfected, they may be able to extract the parasite from a living host. ****It can’t happen. It won’t.****
All the while, our colossal companion Hra out there seems to urge us to go to the Fulgurite Fields post haste. They won’t tell us why, they simply say ‘to fulfil their purpose’. Whatever that means.
Rest for now, Rovers and decide what you wish to pursue first, for tomorrow, we depart.
