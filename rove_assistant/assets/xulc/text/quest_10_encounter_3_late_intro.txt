[artwork=Mo and Makaal]
*Makaal thumbed through the contents of the skarasilk pouch as the sun hung low in the sky. Wiping the sweat from his brow, he tossed the pocket of lyst into the basket with the others. “Another fine day’s work, Mo!”*
*The starling’s tendrils coiled tight around their head for a moment, before casting the tension away, as if to physically reset. “Who would have thought saving Lalos would have been so profitable?” Mo retorted with not-so-subtle lathering of sarcasm.*
*“Me, Mo. Like, actually me. We spoke about this. A lot, actually”. Makaal had been perfecting the formula to blunt Mo’s increasingly sardonic mien, and by the way Mo ignored him, he knew he was getting pretty good. The young merchant knew Mo’s walls wouldn’t hold for long, this conversational war of attrition would inevitably tilt into the favor of Makaal’s relentless siege of denial.*
*Grandpaw’s jaw stretched wide, and a pungent exhalation of tired arkenyn-breath bristling the hairs of Makaals nose. It doesn’t matter how much he loved his companion, he rarely welcomes the scent. With a basket full of lyst and his clan hailing him a hero, Makaal hoped he’d find a greater peace in his heart after returning home, but he does wonder why his greatest pleasure at the moment is tormenting Mo, and why he simply doesn’t care to spend any of the lyst he’s accrued. Ah well, a problem to be cured by earning more lyst. Probably.*

It’s always a strange sensation when you enter the Thunder Mesa. There are no signs, no real outposts, just the transition of mountainous stone to the soft crunch of sand, the rumble-drums of thunder in the distance and the metallic tongue tickle of ionized Air ether. You feel it more sensitively than before. The swelling power of the xulc ****gifts**** - infections in your bodies make the ether around you… sting. Not in a painful way, but as if you’d soaked your bodies in peppervine tea and plunged into icewater. It’s spicy. Hra provides some comfort, however; the monotony of their footsteps provide something of a marching beat to take your attention. Barely a word has been spoken by the starling, but something about their large form, their seeding of plants and stone, provides you with reassurance. Like walking with the living shelter of your own personal mountain ****foul beast foul creature won’t survive won’t be needed you don’t need them you have me you have us.****
As you arrive at Carmizon Reach, you feel a blend of fondness and reservation about seeing your travelling companions again. Though it’s been mere weeks, the world feels very different now. Arriving to the outskirts of Makaal’s clan, you are immediately recognized. The sentry rushes over to you with their arkenyn pup in tow. “Rovers! You’re the Rovers who helped Mo and Makaal save Lalos! I’d recognise you from -” The sentry stops. The arkenyn lets out a low growl. 
You can see the panic in their faces. “Are you... Are you well, Rovers?” 
A quick dismissal of some bad camp food is all you need to push aside the sentries desire to learn more. The concern is still there, of course, but something in them knows better than to keep asking.
“I, I see. Are you looking for Mo and Makaal? They’re not here right now, I’m afraid. Missing, actually. They accompanied the ranger party on a supply run a few noons ago. They should have returned the following morning, but there’s been no sign of them. We were going to send a search party to look for them today, actually. Since you’re here, would you mind havi”- ****your friends will be with us soon all will be together soon.**** The sentry need not finish their response.
Hra flutters their tendrils and moves grinding stone: “There. I sense it.” 
You move.
