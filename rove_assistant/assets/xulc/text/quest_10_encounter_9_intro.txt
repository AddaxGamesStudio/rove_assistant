*Transcribed musings from “Silky”, resident Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*When I was but a young student, I struggled often with the passivity of our study. I thought the querists were too vain, the sophists too navel-gazing, I craved a different, more impactful path. My Fundamentalist at the time saw my strife and sought to sunder it.*
*“Young Silky”, she said as she took me aside, “Have I ever told you about the Mind School?” I had of course, but only through my unofficial extra-curricular activity in the forbidden part of the libraries, so I simply shook my head. She went on to tell me that the Mind School formed out of a rejection of the other School’s principles, and of the core of their curriculum, a principle known as Antarcanism.*
*Antarcanism offers an origin myth, how reality came to be. For the antarcanist, all that existed was simply a whole, known as the Monum. The Monum was all, and all was the Monum. The Monum absolutely did contain all, even the concept that it didn’t. That concept necessarily caused the Monum to create Something Else outside of itself, an act that began a chain reaction. This Something Else needed rules, because without the wholeness of the Monum, it was chaos. So then, the Something Else began by first crafting a boundary, a reality to perceive itself and an itself to do the perception. A Morph, and a Crux respectively.*
*Suffice to say, the syzygy of the Something Else got carried away, creating endless amounts of lesser anima until around four stuck - earth, fire, water and wind. The antarcanists believe this whole thing was a mistake, and the rejection of the Minor Arcana is the path to true enlightenment, where one can subsist solely on the Major Anima. Pure Morph and pure Crux, pure body and pure soul. Much of what they did, when not writing of this, was a prolonged period of intense asceticism that mostly just resulted in self-mummification.*
*It was a strange philosophy. Hard to follow. Probably why the Mind School simply dwindled away. It’s hard to get fresh fur when your registration form is a command to cease existing. Anyway, I think my old teacher was trying to warn me against “getting too involved”. I’m not sure it worked.*

“Aren’t you glad I’m here?” Silky asked with an exuberance you haven’t seen in a while. “Without me, who knows what fate could befall our land.” Silky’s… ‘confidence’ feels familiar. In fact, it all feels familiar. Mo, Makaal and Grandpaw in tow, Hra’s tremendous, coruscating form leading the way. The starling - if you can still call them that, claimed to know how to generate enough Etheric energy that the tihfur ritual could work, and was taking the party there. ****Fool. It can’t work. You’re ours now, we’re one.****
You ignore the voice, because for the first time in a long time, you have genuine hope. Hope for what this might be like when it’s all over. ****You won’t like it.****
Perhaps this is just what your life is to be now. Perhaps this was a calling, a reminder from the elements themselves not to part from each other’s company, but to come together. To do good. To change things. Perhaps it’s even greater - perhaps this parasite guest was perfectly designed to unite the disparate clans of Lalos altogether. ****You don’t know how right you are.****
Hra leads you to the Unsouled Barrens. You fight off a few xulc-infested urns and stomaw - far fewer than last you were here, a sign that Ozendyn and his querists have been doing good work. Hra leads you to another clearing. They love doing that. 
“Rovers,” Hra turns to you all. “This is where we part ways.”  ****Good.**** 
“What?” Makaal asks. 
“I must leave now. It’s my time. Thank you, Rovers. For all you’ve done. For the first time, I have felt true companionship. I have truly been part of a clan.” 
You all look at each other bewildered and dumbfounded. Is Hra just going to… leave?
Makaal, in all his wisdom, breaks the silence again. “I don’t get it. Where are you going? You have a tent somewhere in this dunghole?” 
“Young one,” crackles Hra with uncharacteristic warmth. “I’m going to fulfill my purpose.” 
All of the lightning in Hras body charges. Light comes from inside. They are pure, glowing white now, a sun brought low to make communion with the earth.
“Run,” Silky shouts! 
****RUN.****
Hra grows. Their rock-skin splits and swells, electric blood coagulating and clotting into fresh glass. Hra is the size of a house now. You keep running. They are now the size of a castle. Saplings surge in growth to tremendous trees and foliage. You joked of Hra as a mountain before, but as the space that was once their head reaches into the sky, such jokes feel thin. The earth beneath groans and leaves you maladroit, the light of Hra burns the earth. Your parasite ****screams****. 
The growth slows, the light dims, the booming thunder wanes. You stop running. Adjusting your eyes you see a monolith that didn’t exist before. A giant crystalline spire, an altar of glass and lightning. Crux, Wind and Earth ether provides a sharp contrast to the surrounding Unsouled Barrens. Your parasite is ****still screaming****. In the space between Hra’s forelegs, now an arching entrance to the shrine. It beckons you in. Hra beckons you in.
Mo offers one word, “ascension.” None of you know what it means, but you don’t need to. Silky speaks next. 
“Rovers…” He seems choked up. “It appears Hra has… sacrificed themselves in order to create the focus of Ether we need to cleanse you of the parasite.” ****NO. NO NO NO****
“You must… go inside. Mo, Makaal and I will perform the tihfur ritual as they instructed.”
Mo’s tendrils wave with certainty. Makaal, hiding the tears as well as any man could, grips his own hands. Silky’s voice turns grave. 
“One more thing, Rovers. The Yanshif… gave us a warning. As we lack the tihfur’s bond to Morphic reality, the ritual will require exertion on your part. We will be able to separate the parasite from you on a Crux level, but you must defeat it on a Morphic level. Not physical, but Morphic. It will present itself to you as a nightmare. You must rout it, together. When you undo its Morph, we will finish undoing its Crux. The Minor Arcana will follow.”
Walking inside the crystal shrine of Hra, the ground twists and decays, the vibrant iridescent hallway becomes xulc pods, vast and mutated, out of nothing steps another corrupted Hastadilling.
****FOOLS.**** It speaks in your mind. ****You wish to remove me from you? After all I’ve given? All I’ve offered? I’ll kill you where you stand, and take your bodies after all.**** The Hastadilling charges. ****Remember. This could have been ours.****
