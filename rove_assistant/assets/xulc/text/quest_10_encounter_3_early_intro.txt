[artwork=Mo and Makaal]
*Makaal thumbed through the contents of the skarasilk pouch as the sun hung low in the sky. Wiping the sweat from his brow, he tossed the pocket of lyst into the basket with the others. “Another fine day’s work, Mo!”*
*The starling’s tendrils coiled tight around their head for a moment, before casting the tension away, as if to physically reset. “Who would have thought saving Lalos would have been so profitable?” Mo retorted with not-so-subtle lathering of sarcasm.*
*“Me, Mo. Like, actually me. We spoke about this. A lot, actually”. Makaal had been perfecting the formula to blunt Mo’s increasingly sardonic mien, and by the way Mo ignored him, he knew he was getting pretty good. The young merchant knew Mo’s walls wouldn’t hold for long, this conversational war of attrition would inevitably tilt into the favor of Makaal’s relentless siege of denial.*
*Grandpaw’s jaw stretched wide, a pungent exhalation of tired arkenyn-breath bristling the hairs of Makaal’ s nose. It doesn’t matter how much he loves his companion, he rarely welcomes the scent. With a basket full of lyst and his clan hailing him a hero, Makaal hoped he’d find a greater peace in his heart after returning home, but he does wonder why his greatest pleasure at the moment is tormenting Mo, and why he simply doesn’t care to spend any of the lyst he’s accrued. Ah well, a problem to be cured by earning more lyst. Probably.*

It’s always a strange sensation when you enter the Thunder Mesa. There are no signs, no real outposts, just the transition of mountainous stone to the soft crunch of sand, the rumble-drums of thunder in the distance and the metallic tongue tickle of ionized Air ether. Although the trek to this part of Lalos has been somewhat tainted by tension, anxiety and unexpected gifts to your bodies. Though the King of Storms is at peace, you remember that thunder and lightning need not a monarch to inspire awe and dread.
As you arrive at Carmizon Reach, you feel a blend of fondness and reservation about seeing your travelling companions again. Though it’s been mere weeks, the world feels very different now. Arriving to the outskirts of Makaal’s clan, you are immediately recognized. The sentry rushes over to you with their arkenyn pup in tow. “Rovers! You’re the Rovers who helped Mo and Makaal save Lalos! I’d recognise you from their descriptions anywhere!” 
Not quite how things played out, but you’re far too concerned with your unwelcome passengers to challenge the dewy-eyed sentry. “Are you looking for them? They’re not here right now, I’m afraid. They accompanied the ranger party on a supply run yesterday afternoon - the scouts feel much safer in the company of such powerful heroes as our own Mo and Makaal!” You’re pretty sure you see the sentry shed a tear as they say this. “That being said, they are unusually late. They should have returned this morning. But you’re welcome to wait! My husband would love to meet you, he’s a huge fan.”
Call it a trauma response, call it paranoia, call it a psionic resonance, but something about their delay sets you on edge. Asking for the directions that the ranger party took, you set off hopefully to meet them halfway.
