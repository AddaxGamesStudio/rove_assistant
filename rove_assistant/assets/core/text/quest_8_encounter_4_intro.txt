*At the apex of the great hollow tree, where its ancient heart opens to the starlit sky, the Fire-imbued human stands, her silhouette framed by the glow of a creature wrought in pure flame. The crown, now a radiant marvel of incandescence, flickers and dances as though composed of living embers. Its antlers spiral upward like tongues of fire frozen mid-reach, illuminating the gnarled walls of the hollow with a flickering, golden light. Each step it takes scorches the bark beneath, leaving smoldering prints that whisper of a fury untethered.*
*With a deliberate motion, she thrusts her spiked heel into the bark, the starling core at its tip flaring to life. A low hum reverberates through the tree as the etheric nodes begin to pulse, their light syncing to the rhythm of her breath. One by one, they crack and splinter, releasing streams of molten energy that arc toward her, spiraling around her form like fiery serpents.*
*The woman’s lips curl into a thin, wicked smile as she steps forward, her arm channeling a spiral of flames that erupt from her hand. The flames snake toward the crown, not to harm it, but to encircle it, forming a blazing cage. The conjured pyre dances with her movements, responding to her will as if they are extensions of her being. The crown lunges and thrashes, its antlers crackling as it releases bursts of searing light, but the cage tightens with every motion.*

 Silky grunts and glides back down to where the Rovers and merchant pair are still climbing the highest lips of The Seat of Storms. “We’ve been on the back foot every step of the way here. I would never have guessed in a hundred years that the Star Hunters would accumulate enough power to truly challenge an Addax within their own domain. Perhaps I should have paid more heed to how they were able to establish a galeaper matriarch all that time ago.” He sighs.
“I believe there is a pattern for us to exploit here. Each of Uzem’s progeny have inherited his rage at the clan, this should be no different. Fire often bests Air in direct clashes of ether, we can use this to our advantage. If we restore the etheric nodes, the crown should be able to regain strength and fight back against its tormentors.” The aerios nods as he delivers his plans, confident as ever.
Makaal hums as he listens to Silky’s plan. “The Star Hunters have been journeying in and out of the Thunder Mesa for years now. I suppose they’ve been feeding from Uzem in one way or another all this time. Can we use that against them?” 
“Precisely,” Silky responds. “As ever, Rovers, we’ll be relying on your strength. You’re almost certainly powerful enough to contend with yet another power-drunk ether-caster directly, but we seem to be presented with an opportunity to continue to engender ourselves with Addax Uzem, should it still draw breath. I say we do what we can to earn a King’s favor,” he suggests with a chuckle.
