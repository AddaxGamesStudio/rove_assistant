*It’s the drifting that bothers him most. Era does not strive or struggle. It does not bend or break or claw for meaning the way he has. The way Andiron, and every other beast of the world, does. He has spent what feels like lifetimes amassing his power, forging it from agony and ambition, turning his very bones into conduits of ether so pure it burns him from within.*
*Yet they are still tethered. Chained to Chorus and all its sordid, unrelenting weight.*

Through the highest reaches of the sky above Chorus, Era drifts onward. The archipelago moves like a memory in slow-motion, pulled by unseen forces, its jagged islands cloaked in the etheric gossamer of Air. Era is not a place meant for flesh and blood; it is claimed by starlings. At the heart of the largest island stands… Era, a magnificent tree. Whether the name for the great tree, or the name for the chain of islands came first, none can, or care to, say. Its roots coil deep into the floating island, anchoring the fragment of land against worldly forces that seek to scatter it to the cosmos. Its branches reach upward and outward, fracturing into a thousand glowing petals that seem to drink in the dim light of distant stars.
For those that have had the great fortune to somehow visit Era and can speak plainly of it, they tell of innumerable crystals that decorate the entirety of its grounds. Era is both home to starlings, and a grand cemetery. It is a place of pilgrimage for powerful starlings—one to experience something truly all their own, devoid of the necessity to mimic terrestrial life. As starlings come and go, live and die, they impart their ether across the islands and into the roots of Era, enhancing its affinity ever more. It is said that Era holds the secrets of the world, but there are no seekers on Era. Those that live there do not desire answers. They exist in stillness, in contemplation of the great, indifferent forces that shape all things. Era, untethered, drifts onward.
Naturally, this means that those without the capacity to visit it, fantasize the most about what splendors it could possibly contain. Scholars, alchemists, and killers all the same. Silky is familiar with some of the stories brought back from Era. The floating islands have a natural orbit around Chorus, and he is certain one of the other clans probably has a calendar for its passage over other continents. It hasn’t occurred to him at any point during his planning and organizing over the months to consider it as part of the ongoing series of problems plaguing Lalos—it is, quite literally, disconnected from the world. An isolated system in every respect.
Yet a great kernel of horror is beginning to take root within him as he gazes upon the cluster of floating islands above. One such clan that would care a great deal about a mythologized home of starlings… would be the one that hunts those people to empower themselves. Their increased activity and renewed fervor in pursuit of power across the continent—had he truly underestimated their reach so completely?
