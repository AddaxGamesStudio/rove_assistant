*Kelo recalls a day after another conquest by the Ezmen Queens—*
*Kelo dug a claw under a loosening bit of his chitin, letting out an awkward hiss. “Shouldn’t pick.” Saras admonished. “Growth occurs as the mite matures. Dangerous if they’re removed so soon. They’ll come off eventually, Kelo.” Kelo shuddered and waved an arm dismissively, then emitted an irritated buzzing. “Something troubles?” Saras asked. Kelo tapped a digit against the ezmenite blade that was given to him by the clan’s queens.*
*APPROVAL OBLIGATION BURDEN*
*“Recall this investment as the future draws closer. “*
*The disturbingly pale queen—Femii, he later learned—had said those things during his and his sister’s coming of age celebration. The words had pressed against his mind as she motionlessly, unblinkingly, bore witness to the granting of the siblings’ rank in the clan’s army, alongside the rather brutish Marii. Kelo wondered how many other members of the clan had received these sorts of insidious missives during their conscriptions.*

Saras and Kelo had gone back to usher Mo and Makaal back through the tunnels in secret. Poor Grandpaw could barely fit through even with his body pressed in on itself. The gleam of Silky’s aerios was muted along with the other glittering materials tucked away under a conspicuous bit of cloth in the arkenyn’s baggage. Returning to the crystal formation with the merchants in tow, the keb rasska pair finally began to explain what the army had made a cross-continent march to these mountains for. Hidden within the depths of Lalos are a species of entoman whose carapace is more powerful than any metal. The queens named their clan after this material referred to as “ezmen.” Ezmen comprises the armor, weapons, and other finer equipment that the queens and their army wield. The creatures responsible for the rise of the Ezmen clan are named skara; another keb rasska affectation that alluded to the mandibles spanning the length of their massive bodies. 
While some colonies of skara are isolated, others, however, have seen clans build themselves around the tunnels and formations the entomans left behind. The Ezmen queens did not care what the circumstances were, for the hunt of these hidden creatures was the entire genesis of their army. The clan simply crushed any who did not join the queens’ grand pursuit.
The crystal formation here is not just an ether-infused swathe of rock, Saras and Kelo explain. It is an egg of an unborn skara that is waiting for others of its kind to free it to begin its own tunneling endeavors. This is what their clan has been marched across the continent to find and capture, with that purpose literally pressed into their bodies by keb thoughtweavers.
Guilt is the motivation for the siblings now. Guilt over their contributions to the enslavement and destruction of clans across Lalos, guilt over the indulged pleasures of being ranking soldiers. The appearance of Rovers provides a chance for redemption. Kelo and Saras present a plan to secret away the juvenile skara somewhere safe, and after some discussion, a solid approach takes shape. Unfortunately a camp of the clan’s sentinels stands between your group and the passages the siblings intend to escape through. 
The soldiers must be scattered before any further steps are taken. As it happens, Mo and Makaal know quite a bit about creating distractions and escaping under the press of chaos.
