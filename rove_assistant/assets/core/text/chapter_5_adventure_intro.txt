*For years, the clan had rumors of a great beast that wandered the mountains. Adults would tell the story to children to ensure none ever went hiking alone. When the tihfur finally discovered the marl-starling that had haunted their legends, it was a strange day. He was surprisingly docile for a starling that had been devoid of personhood for so much of his development. Perhaps his immense size had played some part in that? Few beasts dared challenge a walking boulder.*
*Not only was he docile, but he was quite tolerant of the clan as they led him back to their village. Children would climb his rugged surface and swing from his vines. Adults would seek out the shade of his enormity during the day. The haunting tale of the great beast of the mountain disappeared practically overnight, replaced with songs about the gentle giant Hra.*
*Hra became the clan’s guardian for a time. He developed his sentience slowly. It was a day of celebration when he finally spoke his first words. But as any starling does, it was eventually time for Hra to depart. Yet Hra never actually travels beyond the mountains—if you ask him, he claims to be “searching”. Searching from one end of the mountain range and back, day after day, month after month, year after year.*
*To this day, ballads of the gentle giant are passed along the clans that live in the mountains.*

Mo found themselves drifting in and out of an uncharacteristic fatigue. An immensely potent haze of Earth-ether was challenging the starling’s Water-aspected senses. Before Mo could ask for a break to deal with its effects, an unidentifiable roar fills the valley. It tinges the ether haze with anger and fear. Mo knew the sensation all too intimately. Star Hunters had found their prey.
“That’s not a beast—it’s a starling!” Mo shouts. “We have to hurry!” Without so much as checking to see if any of you are prepared for the sudden sprint, the starling ushers Grandpaw ahead on a full gallop. Surprisingly, it’s much easier to keep pace than it used to be, with the gathered strength flowing through your bodies.
Plumes of dust choke out the mountain path ahead. With each stumbling step the huge starling takes, more dirt shoots into the air around it. Surrounding him is a party of Star Hunters, eager for the bounty they had discovered. His form towers above the humans—a colossus of stone and soil, veins of tree roots snaking over and through his body. His four legs, gnarled trunks coated in a layer of rock, smash into the ground, sending shockwaves through the dirt. Cracked boulders and shards of metal are cast at the humans, causing them to scatter before the immense starling.
“We’re here to help!” Mo shouts.
