*O, spectral choir of grief and shade, in this dark serenade conveyed*
*The messengers, with wings so black, in harmony with death’s cold track.*

Gray, pallid, sombre. What should be a forest of deep greens and flashes of vibrant chromatics instead falls to the color of stone and decay. Even the sound of twigs and dead leaves crunching underfoot feels muffled, lending to an unnatural sense of stillness. A morose serenity blankets the woods as pitch-black nektari flutter amidst the trees.
Grandpaw, always with his nose for trouble, rears back in sudden shock. His snout practically peeled back on itself as he snarls and swipes furiously at his nose, literally working to beat back the scent that just assaulted him. Eventually it reaches the rest of your group; a fiercely pungent smell that reeks of noxious waste and spoilage. Nothing stands out as the obvious source of the olfactory offense. On one side of the trees, it smells only of dirt and leaves. On the other, something that only brings hurt to mind.
Silky led your party back east to the Taharik after your last undertaking, where the tihfur messenger visited you shortly after your departure from the Seat of Storms. While some guilt lingers at not immediately diving into the request, the entire forest could have easily been ruined had the Ezmen queens managed to escape the mountains with those immense creatures under their control. The colorless keb, who fashioned herself sovereign of all, may have had even worse things in mind.
Unfortunately, it means that other concerns are now spilling forth into and out of the Taharik. Sable avians are occasionally seen breaking through the forest’s canopy—the shaking and falling of distant trees following after. Were it not for the light produced by the presence of Silky’s conjuration, your trek would seem unnaturally dark. Despite the sun’s best efforts its rays find trouble penetrating the murk that now grips the entirety of the Taharik.
You are not welcome here.
