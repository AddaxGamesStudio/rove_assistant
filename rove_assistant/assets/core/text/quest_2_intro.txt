*Transcribed musings from “Silky,” resident Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*Keb Rasska… Such a complete complement of contradictory and confounding combinations, as usually suggested considering their stories… Ah, forgive me if that was difficult to follow. You see, keb rasska often adopt quite the interesting manner of speech—when they do bother to speak verbally—and I couldn’t help but emulate it while thinking about them. Something to do with their physical makeup? Not a pair of lips between any pair of ilk! You’ll find they rely upon a number of different ways to convey information between themselves and others, from onerous orations to gushing gestures to mental missives! Despite the quirks to their communications many would still give any disciple of the Mouth a skip from their spear. Quite shrewd negotiators—after all, more minds manifest more mischief!*

The booming footfalls of “Grandpaw”—the massive arkenyn bonded to Makaal that everyone has managed to settle atop of— reverberate loudly through the valley. Before long, Silky’s aerios descends from its flight to Grandpaw’s head, drawing a chuff of minor complaint from the animal. The gleaming avian turns to face the mounted party and takes the opportunity to begin a discussion regarding the strategy for approaching the army further along. Mo, whose extra limbs developed from their clan once living with a population of keb rasska, is familiar enough with their methods of communication and offers to facilitate a meeting. 
With the scorching heat of the sun now bearing down from directly overhead, Grandpaw lets out a low half-bark and slows his gallop. As fortune would have it the marching army hasn’t gained much ground from Uzem’s Throne and has only just begun their hike up the steeper inclines that surround the mountain range. Suddenly, Makaal clicks his tongue in irritation. Members of the army’s rearguard have noticed Grandpaw and your entourage. 
A wave of rapid movement rolls through the antennae and fins of the sentries; signals and warnings communicated in near-silence. “Seems that is the cue,” Mo says before leaping to their full height on the back of Grandpaw. Arms and the front pair of their legs lift up in a series of non-verbal signals to the sentries. A good number immediately relax at the communicated intent, though Mo doesn’t share the specifics of the message. One of the keb rasska begins to hike back down to meet with your group. She appears to be a flagbearer of some sort, and passes her charge to another before they separate from their position completely. On the army’s banner is an unfamiliar emblem; an iridescent geometric pattern that at a distance seems to resemble a crystal serpent? The rasska is upon you before anyone thinks to question Silky about the iconography, her fins fluttering with the speed of her movement. Unnoticed until getting this close, her smaller keb partner clambers on to her shoulders and begins motioning toward your party. Each of you disembarks from Grandpaw and performs the standard greeting-salute of a Rover, with Mo and Makaal motioning by tipping their heads and turning up outstretched palms.
