*So heed the call of midnight’s choir,*
*And shun the miasma’s ghastly mire,*
*For in its grip where shadows dwell,*
*One might be lost within the spell.*

Two monstrous avian creatures squat in the middle of the swamp atop a mound of gathered corpses. You see streaks with their necks twisted, briarwogs with their limbs shredded, terranape with their legs crushed, and plenty of other indeterminate prey mixed between. Squelching, sloshing, slurping. Enjoying their banquet of rotten flesh, the two monsters wear similar expressions of delight.
One of the pair is truly massive. A cloak of manifold wings spans from shoulder to tail, each one cast in razor pinions. A naked skull protrudes from its spine, its ivory length splattered in the fluids of its kills. Three eyes of pride, fever, and adoration trail from its meals to the partner it shares them with. Every so often it preens the smaller of the pair, who must be the woman you pursued here, which involves ripping free one of her pin-feathers in a spray of ichor that coats them both.
Circling the scene is a host of broken vessels, each adding their “voice” to the cacophony of birdsong emanating from the monstrous pair. Their tendrils undulate wildly as they heedlessly crash into one another. For all of the viciousness they demonstrated in the village, they seem much less distressed amidst this macabre display.
Mo holds out their limbs and their tendrils sway in the putrid, but placid, breeze. “That’s… words fail to describe just how strange this flow of ether is. That large beast is for certain the source of the chaos. There’s… something flows between the tihfur. I think it’s weakening itself to empower its mate. Please, exercise caution, Rovers.”
