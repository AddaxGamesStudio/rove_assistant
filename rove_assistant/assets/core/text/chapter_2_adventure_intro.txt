*Scratchpad of alchemist Zesat*
*The starlings have taken to their assigned roles with fervor. This is good! Nu has ether sensitivity like nothing I’ve ever seen. The diligence of Mo rivals even the best of the students I’ve seen. They work together as a fine keb rasska pair. I believe Mo has even begun growing simulated keb limbs. Such flattery!*
*Perhaps there can be a chance for resting in the future. They’ll take over the clan’s crafting circles before they even realize. As they should. I think they learned from the best!*

The starling, Mo, seems to prefer spending more time toiling away at the saddle of equipment than anything else. As Silky guides you through new ether channeling exercises, the starling sneaks a peek when they think nobody is paying attention. Their interest is warranted—Prime Rovers are not named often, and to see a group of them earn their accolades together is an extreme rarity.
Mo sets down their tools and turns to face your group properly. “If you’re really searching for a way to score your shells, perhaps you could travel to my clan’s harvesting grounds. I’m quite familiar with the zyderos gathered from the barrier island and I think your talents with ether would serve quite well in utilizing it.”
Silky studies Mo for a moment. Two unblinking entities made of pure ether. The silence stretches between them, until Makaal breaks first and swats playfully at Mo. “I think you could already guess, but that little reef tends to be rather dangerous most of the year. What I think Mo means to imply is that the Rovers may find it a pleasant distraction after… what just happened.”
The aerios moves a wing to stroke an imaginary beard, before remembering his actual body is completely disconnected from the conjuration. “I hadn’t accounted for such a far-off detour to the west, but… perhaps there is merit. I admit, I’d like to see what you have planned! Hand-crafted and uniquely-attuned etheric constructs are also worth a favor.
Journeying to Zydero Reef means several days of travel, during which Silky and Mo discuss the conditions of the ocean and what might be awaiting on the island during this season. Though really the only thing that matters, in your case, is ensuring that the creatures currently spawning on the island don’t spread their way back to the mainland.
