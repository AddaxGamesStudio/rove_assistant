*While we zusag may prefer the paths less traveled, it is the paths most traveled upon which keb rasska built themselves. You see, they were not always keb rasska, but once upon a time, keb and rasska. Keb were small and delicious-looking creatures, much like us, that caught the attention of every hungry predator in the area. Rasska, however, were neither small nor looked like much of anything, what with their spectral and glass-like skin. It was certainly a momentous day in those ancient times when the first keb—so afraid of everything around it and only able to keep to the paths its ilk had drawn before it—was attacked by a predator and then rescued by a rasska that had hidden somewhere along that very same path. So began the very long and very prosperous journey of the keb rasska—the respected path-builders of the current age.*

Too proud of their own crystalline and chitin armaments as they were, the queens were more than happy to allow Mo and Makaal the opportunity to work with the mundane scales of the defeated gruv. Marii, impressed with your performance in clearing the mountain passage, now seems very interested in spending more time getting to know your party. Kelo and Saras aren’t far away either, having apparently received some accolades for gathering Rovers in service to the clan. The keb queen—Femii, apparently bonded to Marii—remains rather dispassionate, but Marii explains that is nothing unusual for her.
Marii’s gaze bares down on each of you as she makes her proposal; apparently the march through and up the mountains has taken a significant toll on her army, and she desires the strength of Rovers to act as the vanguard through the unexplored depths of the caverns. “The clan still needs rest. I wish each of the soldiers could call such strength their own, though this wish is less than reasonable—they can’t call themselves Rovers as you can.” Despite her stern expression her words sound honest enough. It’s surprising enough that a keb rasska speaks their desires so plainly given the difficulty of common speech for them. The few dozen keb rasska that are part of the armed complement of the clan army are clearly exhausted. Bruised flesh, drooping antennae, chipped shells, and many leaning on their weapons for support just to stand. The clan’s journey has not been as easy as perhaps hoped.
Marii separates to tend to her retinue and you return to Mo and Makaal to make preparations for traversing the depths of the caves. Kelo and Saras intercept and follow behind you, apparently with orders to accompany you as something of a guide through the subterrain. Once you finally return to Mo and Makaal, they wave you over with a fresh set of armor fashioned from the Gruv and a handful of small, glowing lanterns. Mo affixes them to each of you as Makaal speaks. “These should mostly help down there, though chances are these’ll probably draw some attention from the locals. Take care down there, Rovers!”
