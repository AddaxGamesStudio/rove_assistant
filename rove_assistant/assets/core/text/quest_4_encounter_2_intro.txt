*“Gather up!” cried the lead of the forward party. Her streak companion squawked loudly to emphasize the shout. Five elite ether channelers rounded up in front of her, with each of their own adjutants and menagerie behind the line they formed. Each one had been selected for this mission due to their unique affinities—a major component of what they would need to subdue the King of Storms and siphon his ether.*
*“This is no ordinary hunting excursion! Our usual methods won’t work, and that’s why everyone here has been assembled for the task. Eztu cleared our path for us initially with her… particular talents managing a galeaper brood, and the rest of our folks have been busied with the addax-spawn to give us this chance.” She paces back and forth as she debriefs the group.*
*“We have our tools, we have our orders. We rip out his ether and make it ours one bite at a time. Let’s bring a measure of peace to our southern families, and prove to Master that we’re more than ready for bigger prey!” A dozen or more humans and beasts erupt in cheers before beginning their preparations for the eventual descent into Uzem’s Shrine.*

Mo and Silky are deep in conversation. Makaal scratches behind Grandpaw’s ears idly. He has enough trouble keeping up with Mo when the starling gets into one of their creative moods, and the words flying between the pair barely resemble language as he knows it. Mo is curled over a particularly long and rough-looking spear as Silky’s aerios hops from limb to limb, in a rather poultry-like fashion, whipping his wings and emphasizing certain regions of the spear with Mo nodding along.
Before the merchant can get too lost in his reminiscing, Mo excitedly calls the group over. “With Silky’s help I think we’ve achieved a way to cross the fulgurcaps without getting caught off guard like before. I can still sense the same presence that… consumed the crown here. Slightly different, but I think it’s all from the same source: Uzem. We believe something has caused Uzem to… fracture his power of storms. That’s why the storms aren’t behaving as they usually would and why my body feels so disrupted by the rains. There are multiple lesser ‘conjurations’ each discharging their powers without a guiding force.
“As the addax grows from the crown, and a crown is aspected to Crux, we should be able to use Crux ether to draw out his power. Crux always seeks balance, and so his disparate facets are attempting to anchor themselves to the next closest thing to the addax: his offspring. I don’t think we can stop this from happening, but we can possibly control the place where it happens. As you travel the fulgurcaps, look for a potent source of ether and thrust this spear at its base. It should attract the facet—or perhaps the crown it has attached itself to.” Mo holds out the spear to the Rovers, now adorned with myriad geometric carvings and glowing with the faint hue of ether-infused power.
