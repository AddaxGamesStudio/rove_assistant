*Mo and Makaal banter as they travel a nondescript road.*
*Makaal scratches his head in thought. “So you’re suggesting that ether has… flavor?” he asks. “Isn’t that obvious? Morph, Water, Earth, you know. The whole bag of them.”*
*Mo’s tendrils wobble as they consider how to respond. “It’s more specific. This was difficult for me, but Nu’s particular senses were something not all that uncommon amidst humans and tihfur… supposedly?” The starling digs into one of the leather pouches strapped to Grandpaw and pulls out a round ball–a firegrit explosive. “Gatherings of ether differ from each other. The Fire ether contained in one of our explosives might behave slightly differently compared to another. One may reach higher while another reaches further. Nu suggested this was the case for everything. Lands would quake because the Earth ether… felt a certain way.”*
*Makaal squints back at Mo before returning his attention to the path, keeping his eyes out for wayward signs of danger. “Would being able to tell how ether ‘feels’ make your crafting any better?”*
*Mo waves an arm in resignation. “I wish I could tell you.”*

Makaal tightens his grip on Grandpaw’s barding. Heights have never really bothered him, but this wasn’t just the trail of a mountain pass, this might as well have been the literal top of the world. No matter how much the old sage might protest its veracity, nothing so far had dissuaded Makaal from the common wisdom of “lightning strikes that which is tallest.” To make matters worse the entire hollow seems to be a nursery for wrathbones–detestable creatures that make any region they inhabit their own personal oven.
Still, for all of his woes, what an incredible opportunity! Who else could claim to have visited the Thundering Peak? As if to answer his question, a morose roar bellows from the heart of the shrine. Deep below, the Star Hunter clan can be seen attempting to subdue the immense form of Addax Uzem. Even in its exhausted state, a single wave of its head sends forth powerful bursts of elemental energy in every direction.
One such motion casts off a much brighter and menacing wave of energy. Uzem’s facet of destructive power–one heavily aspected to Fire. With a spiraling trail of pure anger and resentment, it razes its way out of the heartwood and up to the crown that had no opportunity to escape the avatar of its father’s rage. Makaal takes his opportunity, grips Mo to his side, and ushers Grandpaw back down beneath the scorching blasts ripping their way across the peak of the great tree.
Once more the merchant and his entourage are huddled together in the hollow of a bough in Uzem’s territory. He can’t help it–Makaal bursts into laughter at being trapped in this same situation once again. Grandpaw and Mo whirl on him in surprise.
“Mo, did I ever tell you how the trees outside the Thunder Mesa reproduce?” Makaal prompts. Mo shakes their head. “They reach a point in their lives where they dry out and become kindling for the next heat wave or lightning storm. Once they catch aflame, the wood pops and spreads their seeds across the savannah. I hadn’t really thought too much about it before now. Maybe that’s how they fight back against pests and vermin. They burn themselves, and everything within, before they’re eaten away.”
