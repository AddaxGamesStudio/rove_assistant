*Era rustles gently in the breeze. A handful of petals drift from the canopy of the great tree and into the tendrils of the starling working between its boughs. These, too, would be used in the construction of the next piece of art that is to be stored in one of the displays of the outer islands. Every few months, a starling was selected to scale Era and gather weakening branches. As it absorbed more ether and grew ever larger, the branches obscured by the thickest parts of the canopy would start to wither. This was a practice brought to Era decades prior, impressed upon a starling that grew with humans.*
*Two starlings are engaged in a spirited debate. Eventually, the younger of the pair delivers a conclusion that surprises the older starling. The two reiterate their discussion and agree on the consensus achieved. They then begin to discuss the importance of their discussion. It is agreed to be of middling relevance, and so they will share their thoughts in one of the outer islands. The travel is satisfying as they descend into one of the hollow chambers. When they arrive, one of the starlings extends a single tendril that curls in upon itself. After a moment of concentration, it hardens, and the other starling severs it free and drops it into the clay canister. This was how Era fashioned their libraries, impressed upon a starling that grew with zusag.*
*Chimes fill the space of the glowing hollow. A lone starling kneels on a pedestal, surrounded by a circle of other starlings. Each holds a different instrument fashioned from the resources of Era. Clay pipes, crystalline chimes, wooden drums. One starling even sings, though the lyrics are simply emotion given voice and hold no true structure. The lone starling is old and diminished. They resemble a silvan whose wreath is that of pure Fire. With no desire to leave the confines of Era and replenish themselves, a rite is held instead as the last vestiges of their ether begins to burn away. They wish for their core to be fashioned into a light for this very chamber. This was what Era practiced as a funeral, impressed upon a starling that grew with tihfur.*

Silky stretches from his perch upon Grandpaw’s head, looking for any sign of the sources of ether that Mo had detected. The starling can only vaguely gesture in three directions. “I think this can work. If we had more time I could even use the refuse, but for now I believe the concentrated objects I’m feeling are the right choice. Their ether is… inspiring.” Mo says.
“The clan is also everywhere, and I’d bet my left leg they’re going to be attracted to that ether as well.” Makaal retorts. He sighs and looks back at each of you with a tired smile. “But whatever happens, I’m more than happy to bet on your strength!”
