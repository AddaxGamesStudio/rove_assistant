*Entry within The Barren Quire from “Mockhorn.” Scribe of The Wake.*
*Structure is at the heart of any effort to stem chaos. We find ourselves at the heart of an unrelenting stretch of systems that feed off of one another to generate an endless amount of disorder. To combat this we must each become systems of order within ourselves. Our spirits must be indomitable in the face of an uncaring expanse of hunger and greed.*
*Structure requires support. We must individually be the stanchions of a greater whole. Together we will illuminate the churning dark, one battle at a time. Such is the foundation of The Wake. Every member we take on will suffer as they’re molded to a part of the greater shape. This process cannot be forced nor expedited. Their unique contours must be accounted for within our framework. That they would serve at all—this first brick is the most important.*

“Talented at tumbling into trouble.” That was what their mother had told the triplets time and time again. There was also never a situation they couldn’t squeeze out of! Such was the justification for journeying into the blackened heart of Lalos and seeing just how far they could push themselves. The desire to abscond with their findings was replaced with a desire to know more as they slipped their way through the patrolling monsters of the Barrens. Terrifying tales told over and over to try and discourage merely looking in the direction of the wasteland too closely, but nobody would ever answer their questions related to the sheer mystery of the place.
Perhaps something could be said for listening to their elders in this case. While plenty of interesting treasures and stories lay buried here, the dangers they were warned about were practically worse than the tales. Dodging the tendrils of broken starlings, escaping the jaws of monstrous maws, and keeping their wits about them as they explored one end of the waste to the other. If not for sympathy and pity for the warrior Ozendyn, they likely would have fled the region days prior.
Said sympathy had its limits. Ozendyn was clearly desperate and wanted—needed, really—allies in his fight against the endless trickle of monsters throughout the Barrens. There certainly used to be others, but the triplets could guess what had happened based on the increasing frenzy of activity across the wastes. Any desire to join the dwindling warrior clan was stymied by the stark reminder that this was a place of death and desolation.
But the triplets were always looking for an opportunity to ease the warrior’s burdens, and what a surprise when the latest opportunity came. Ozendyn showing up to the nest they had been scouting with a full complement of warriors! Who could pass up a chance to rub it in the ears  of friends and family that they went to the most dangerous place in Lalos and not only came back, but with the experience of fighting alongside Rovers?
