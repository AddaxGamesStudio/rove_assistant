*Transcribed musings from “Silky”, resident Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*Tihfur are not so different from we zusag. Both of our peoples relish challenges—finding thrills where it aligns with our principles. Tihfur are merely more… specific… in their pursuits. Bound by… a more physical approach to their problems. This reflects their relationship to the element of Morph. The limitations of the body. Their most dreaded legends describe scenarios in which balance was eschewed—their “natural order” and the limitations of such—broken. How interesting that their greatest fears come not from distortions of either of what they consider souls, but of the body shared.*

Mo, Makaal, and Silky all agree that when a tihfur clansman strikes out to ask for help, it’s likely to be worse than was suggested by the messenger. This is likely a situation far out of the control of any clan. “I do believe that we should make haste!” the aerios acting as Silky’s eyes, ears, and unremitting mouth, proclaims.
Fighting one’s way through the tangle of outer forests is an arduous endeavor. Tihfur clans prefer to keep as much of their territory as untouched as possible, relying on their natural advantages to outhunt the predators that would threaten their livelihoods. Silky emphasizes this further as he details the specific nature of this particular clan; the Yanshif. Their bodies shift into large avians with powerful talons, swift flight, and the capacity to see perfectly in the murk and darkness. Nocturnal hunters that rely upon stealth and overpowering force. That they are desperate enough to ask for assistance from outsiders is all the more worrying.
Most tihfur cultures highly value the predictable ebbs and flows of nature within their territories. The Taharik, a wide stretch of woodland in the southeast claimed by the Yanshif clan, has been encroached upon by the ever-growing swamps and marshes that separate it from the edge of Lalos. What was once a natural boundary is now a breeding ground for a number of creatures the Yanshif are less equipped to handle, being a clan of almost strictly arboreal hunters. Rather than transforming their geography—more often the domain of keb rasska or human-led clans—tihfur clans prefer to migrate entirely to a more suitable home over time. In this case, the issues presented by the growth of the swamp are not imminent and would take many more years before they drive the clan from their current home. 
It’s possible a clan of entrenched and veteran hunters could be entirely overrun by a seasonal surge of invading marshland beasts; that is exactly the sort of thing Rovers are trained to contend with. But there could be something more going on. The first step is to find out why the clan felt the need to send out a messenger at all.
