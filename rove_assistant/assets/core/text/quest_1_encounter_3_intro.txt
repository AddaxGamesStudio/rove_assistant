*Some hours after a Yanshif ascension ritual—*
*The Dominant looked down at the pair perched at the bottom of the nest-home. The girl, clever, but reserved; the boy, brash, but passionate. Fresh from their third patterning—Morph still potent in the runes inscribed through their skin and feathers. He made sure his bloodied arm was out of sight from the girl, busy at work preening every inch of her. She was thoroughly recounting the week’s hunts to the boy and planning for the upcoming winter. The Dominant was pleased, for they would be excellent leaders to the clan. It had been some time since the Yanshif flew with two Dominant. A scroll was collected and carried down to the pair. Both rose to attention as the Dominant approached and unfurled the scroll.*
*Between sprawls of text written in the language of kin are images of a skilled tihfur that easily overcomes their every challenge. But with each victory the tihfur grows darker and more misshapen. “What you see transcribed is no mere legend, but a warning. The Ahma is a very real threat to all kin. When kin put their essence at risk to protect a home, the natural Morphic energies within us resonate with that desire, empowering our bodies, our Haya—everything. But our bodies are not suitable conduits for such uncontrolled powers. Over time it can corrupt us if we allow it. To become Ahma is to lose sight of who, and what, you are. Once you are Ahma there is no longer tihfur. Morph has taken over completely. It consumes the body and Haya both as its own vessel for its whims. The very place you sought to protect will eventually become a graveyard for you and everyone you once loved.”*
*The Dominant could only hope they both would remember these lessons.*

As your group follows after Zeepurah the faint rays of light reaching the forest floor gradually become more obscured by a variety of structures built in and around the trees. It would make sense that a clan of avian-shifters makes their homes primarily in the treetops. Occasionally a frightened tihfur can be seen peeking out from their home down towards your party. Howls echo through the trees—peppered with the sounds of splintering and crashing wood.
Zeepurah grimaces as she flexes a transformed talon where a hand once was. Creaking and snapping emit from inside of her body as she calls upon her Morphic power. “No more forgiveness. He thinks he can steal our families from their nests? Destroy our home? I will suffer this no longer! Rovers, I ask your assistance in tending to the remainder of my flock.”
