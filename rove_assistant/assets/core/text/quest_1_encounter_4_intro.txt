*Zeepurah recalls an evening spent with her mate after inheriting leadership of the Yanshif—*
*Hasayon held up the two massive and limp corpses of the streak—a quaint name granted to the spindly avian pests—and flashed me his most feral grin. I humored him with a laugh and marked our patrol in the trunk. It was one of those small necessities he was prone to forgetting. So consumed with the hunt as to lose sight of why we stalked these parts of the Taharik. No matter. I would soon train him so thoroughly that even if his mind forgot, his body would not. Our new flight as the Dominant of the Yanshif would burden us with this and more with each passing day.*
*“My love, are you so excited for dinner, or does your tail wave for me?” I teased him.*
*“The first verse always begins with you, no matter how solemn or jubilant my songs are to be. I cannot deny a thrill to finally having plucked the gristle from our coats. Too long have these lovebirds been pretending to lay claim to our roost.” He twisted his head slightly, his Hayin dilating as I entered his view. I couldn’t contain the shudder that prickled at my feathers; so rare was it that a hunter and his Haya aligned so perfectly as within Hasayon. Shame that they each shared the same numb skull.*
*“Do you not feel we are much the same as they?” I asked, motioning to the dead avians held in each of his hands.*
*“They suffered to mistake our lands for their own and thought to extract blood tithe from the children they attacked! My regret, as it so often is, was not listening to your instincts over my own to determine where they nested. Forgiveness asked, my muse,” he muttered.*

The night was oozing through the pale dusk and would soon plunge the marsh into complete darkness. Mo’s azure fluorescence and Zeepurah’s pulsing tattoos are all that keep the gloom at bay. Makaal and Grandpaw had tracked ahead just far enough to confirm the gurgling stream could be heard before returning to the safety of the group. It was this stream that Zeepurah said had to be crossed to find the roost of the Nah.
Makaal broke the silence. “I’ve never seen anything like what’s happening here—and that’s coming from somebody who has traded blows with Star Hunters. Zeepurah, just what is all of this?” he asked while nervously rubbing one of Mo’s tendrils that had drifted up toward him.
“How much do you know about kin, trader? Not just the clans, but what lies in our very hearts? The stories held within our bodies?” Zeepurah asks.
Makaal traces a finger across the ink along his neck as he ponders her question. “Not enough, though that is hardly an answer worth a scale. I would offer that I’ve only seen the good, I think,” he replies.
Zeepurah whips a talon out, signaling for silence and stillness. “Hold, Rovers. Something feels-” before she can finish, the forest is plunged into chaos as a ground-shaking roar erupts from everywhere at once. An entire copse of trees suddenly lifts itself from the ground, shaking loose a number of kifa, nektari, and other denizens that were hiding inside. Then it turns to face you—two giant eyes illuminating the mottled bark around its face. Rivulets of sticky ichor run from its muzzle down its chin.
Zeepurah curses loudly and identifies the creature as one her clan refers to as Hokmala. A rather ancient, and normally docile, grovetender that has now fallen under the same thrall that captured the Nah. The stream that divides the forest from their marsh can be heard nearby. Hokmala’s sole intent appears to be barring the way.
