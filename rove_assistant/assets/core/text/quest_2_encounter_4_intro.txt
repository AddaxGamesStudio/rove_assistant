*A memory from Ezmen Queen Femii—*
*Worthless. Each and all. From the day she first hatched, Femii had sensed just how pitiful everybody surrounding her was. She, too, was weak, but only in body. Her chitin was soft and colorless, forever marking her as an aberration. No matter. Her mind was exceedingly powerful; the power of Morph allowing her to twist others to her will with a mere thought.*
*Marii had worked tirelessly to become the strongest in their birthclan. Years spent in constant training just to protect her “beloved” sister from those that feared and ostracized her. Femii could see Marii’s thoughts so clearly, as if looking through glass. Even Marii carried the weight of resentment. Buried so deep that perhaps Marii herself wasn’t even aware of them, but it was there all the same. Fine. Marii was useful, like any beast of burden, and Femii would keep her until she found something better. Something stronger.*
*Ezmenite was merely another tool. The skara were key. Femii would unlock their secrets.*

Stress seems to be weighing heavily on Kelo and Saras. The map was marked with a passage that lies directly on the other side of the skara’s egg and is where they directed the group. With a look of trepidation, the siblings begin to repeatedly clash together their ezmenite equipment, generating a resonant chiming that echoes near-endlessly throughout the tunnels. As the echoing peals of the ezmenite reaches a head-splitting volume, the walls around you begin to quake. Grandpaw whips around to face a part of the cave and rumbles with a deep growl.
With a piercing crack that quells all other noise, a giant spear of ezmenite suddenly breaks through the wall the arkenyn growled at. Everyone pulls back as more spears of ezmenite puncture the wall. With one last burst of effort the wall collapses entirely and a hulking creature shrouded in the violet crystals drives its way through the debris. A skara, freshly hatched from its egg. You now realize that this is the same creature that the Ezmen clan bears on its emblems. It clatters over to Kelo and brushes its antennae against the keb’s chitin and ezmenite blade. He seems to relax slightly as he runs a claw against the creature’s razor-sharp legs. Saras brushes dust from herself and grins at the rest of you. All according to plan.
For the next stage of the plan, the skara will need to be led through the caverns to a place that the siblings believe will give it the opportunity to escape from the clan’s clutches. Doubtless the earlier distraction has run its course and the recalled soldiers will be ready to interfere with the effort. Fortunately the creature is hardy and seems keen to obey Kelo’s desires—leading it through the winding passages should be simple enough.
