[artwork=Mo and Makaal]
*Transcribed musings from “Silky,” Fundamentalist of the Mist clan.*
*Alchemy, industry, ecology… ether lies at the heart of all of these, yet to my reckoning we have barely begun to scratch the surface. We yield decent respect to the various keb rasska clans who literally name themselves along some of these disciplines, but of course their focus tends to be so narrowly defined. Similarly, every major record we’ve compiled of theran, silvan, and entoman alike are all bereft of elaborated detail.*
*Surely we can all do better. Perhaps this is something to bring forward during the next caucus…*

Makaal tumbles back to the alcove he has been calling home for the past day, another box in hand. The human beams triumphantly as he shows his prize to the starling and arkenyn huddled inside, his grin showing no worry toward the danger he has just escaped. “You see, Mo! I told you I could do it.” he exclaims.
Mo, a starling replete with water ether and limbs reminiscent of a keb, waves one of their dripping tendrils. “Yes. Good. Just thirty or so more trips through the starving galeaper.” Makaal scratches his nose and turns to face the arkenyn, hoping for a more positive response. Arkenyn are large, white, quadrupedal therans native to the central band of Lalos. This furry theran in particular opts to ignore the merchant and adjusts his heavy frame to try and find a more comfortable position to continue his rest. Makaal sighs in defeat, “Grandpaw, can’t you at least pretend to be proud of me?” His request falls upon fuzzy, round, deaf ears. 
“Well, what have we here? I was under the impression that this shrine was no place for the well-reasoned...” croaked an old, and oddly ringing, voice. The merchant whips his head around, frantically searching for the source. “Hello?! Where are you? Can you help us? I may be swift and brave, but I am definitely sure we would be better off handling our situation with some help!” Makaal shouts at the entrance of the alcove. Mo simply allows their tendrils to drift outside. The ether-sensitive sensory limbs are drawn towards a particularly bright aerios conjuration.
“That’s right, my pelagic peer, it is indeed the avian hence that speaks. Assistance can certainly be arranged, but what possessed you to take flight of your senses and climb The King of Storm’s Throne… during a storm?” Silky balks, equally as surprised to find a small party aside from his own this far from safety. Makaal peers out from the alcove to face the speaker. “Would you believe there wasn’t a storm when we first decided to travel through this valley? Not to mention the surprise of a galeaper swarm… If you can help us, I’m more than happy to bargain away any of our wares you recover!”
The aerios tilts its head and lets out a short chuckle. “Well, let us twist your misfortune to fortune on this day, shall we?”
