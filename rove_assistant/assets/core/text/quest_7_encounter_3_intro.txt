[artwork=Broken Vessel]
*Two starlings are fleeing from a band of ruthless humans. The sparse trees and hills between the starlings and their clan’s commune will take at least another hour to cross at their current pace. As crafters and minders, the starlings haven’t spent time learning how to fight or flee. As hunters and killers, the humans know best how to pursue and engage. Gleaming ether crystals embedded into their bodies are a testament to their practice.*
*Both starlings let their tendrils wrap together, communicating all of their ideas and emotions to each other in an instant. Pessimism and optimism in equal measure. No matter what happens, they’ll be together forever.*
*Those thoughts never falter, even when the humans manage to capture one of the starlings and strip them of their ether piece by piece. When their core is fully exposed and wrenched from the body that formed around it. When the cries of their sibling echoe across the coast and draw their clan’s guards out in force.*

Screeching and howling fills the air as you trek deeper along the writhing landscape. A gruesome scene is laid out—one which finally gives some context to the heightened pandemonium spreading across the Barrens. The Star Hunter clan, likely emboldened by their failure to harvest Uzem’s energies, have migrated to a more familiar source of power to them: starling cores. One of the distorted humans bellows a laugh as he grips a broken vessel by the tendrils and ruthlessly thrusts his swollen arm through its screaming jaws. The veins of the man’s arms begin to glow a dull purple, and soon the screaming of the vessel is replaced with the strained groans of the human. 
Crunching and tearing follow as he wrenches his arm back out of the broken vessel. Held in his hand is a small, jagged core of pure Morph. He drops the limp starling to the ground which quickly melts away without its etheric core holding its form together. The human lets out a victorious roar as he impales the core into his chest, the muscles beneath his flesh writhing as they soak in the ether. His reptilian companion-beast, hosting their own jagged core impaled within their head, hisses a declaration of rage before they both leap towards the next vessel nearest to them.
Mo responds with their own series of emotional outbursts, not caring about the circling monstrosities drawn to the commotion. The crafter wraps all of their tendrils around the core they’ve carried, doing whatever they can to keep it hidden. Makaal attempts to reach Mo but is met without any sort of reaction. He shakes his head. “We’ll stay back here for now. I don’t think I need to ask you for this as a favor,” he says, motioning his head towards the party of cackling humans chasing down their prey.
Ozendyn shakes his head solemnly as he draws his blade from its sheath. “The Unsouled are feral dangers that need culling, but for a clan to debase themselves so thoroughly in a bid for power… Rovers, what is happening over the rest of Lalos?” he asks. Silky perches on his shoulder opposite to Gargaki and waves a wing across the scene. “Open wounds that have turned to infection. Let us be the healing agents tonight.”
