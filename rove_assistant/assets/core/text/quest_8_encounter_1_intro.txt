*Two starlings are fleeing from a band of ruthless humans. In the shadows of a forest that glows faintly under the light of a pale moon. They rush desperately, their forms rippling with an iridescent sheen. Each step of their undulating limbs leaves behind faint trails of bioluminescence, a sorrowful mark of their escape. Their tendrils, delicate and translucent, intertwined with a frantic urgency, conveying emotions too deep for sound—fear, sorrow, and above all, a vow to endure.*
*A single human rises above the trees, each limb run through with the crystalline remains of his successful hunts. Their figure obscures the moonlight, casting a jagged shadow across the canopy. Twin howls fill the air, and the flash of a smile slips across Eclipse’s face.*

On one side stands the Star Hunters, draped in robes that shimmer like rain-soaked silk, their hands raised in defiance of the sky. Each motion of their crystal-impaled hands conjures winds that howl like lamenting ghosts, and rain that cascades in crystalline daggers. “How sublime,” murmurs one woman, her cold eyes gleaming. “This power will be mine. Perhaps they’ll call me The Queen of Storms!” She snaps at the ghostly wisps of electricity still lingering in the air, each filament absorbing into the crystals impaled into her limbs. She giggles to herself all the while.
With each spark she absorbs, the air around her begins to twist and spiral with greater fervor. Her companion spreads its wings wide, bearing the disposition of a violent storm, and takes to the sky—trailing threads of wind produced by its plumage. It circles above her, absorbing as much Air ether as it can, every mote causing its feathers to grow more sharp and lustrous. Lesser beasts crowd around, enthralled by the power on display.
Their foe, gleaming and unyielding, is a crown infused with almost pure lightning. Its antlers branch like a storm itself, crackling with threads of azure and white. Each step it takes scorches with an electric afterglow, leaving smoldering scars on the ground. The beast moves, not with the clumsy tread of theran life, but with the elegance of power incarnate, each leap a dance step that challenges its adversary. 
The crown turns its luminous gaze upon the empowered avian, and for a beat, time seems to halt. Then comes the fury—a bolt of lightning, a crack so sharp it cleaves the sky. The human’s protective energies absorb the strike but falter under its might, billowing like a poorly-hitched tent. The outspoken Star Hunter laughs and swings herself about in joyful defiance of the crown’s resistance.
The keb rasska have a phrase for this situation—”The foe of another foe, is often friend.”
