The Palpitating Air
Sunlight breaks through the weakening haze surrounding the swamp. Time returns to its usual ebb and flow. Color seeps back into the edges of your vision as the corpse of the behemoth tihfur rattles out its last breath.
“Hasayon, my love… What have you done…” Even at a whisper, you hear the woman’s cries clearly. Muted splashing can be heard as she makes her slow trudge into the waters toward you. Her body looks much less haggard. While she herself looks somewhat gaunt, the rough browns and subtle yellows of her plumage are in full display. A near full recovery from the transformation that she was trapped within.
She finally introduces herself as Zeepurah, one of the two Dominant (and now the one and only) of the Yanshif clan. She asks for you to watch over her as she engages in funerary rites for the abominable tihfur that pulled everything into this mess. He was Hasayon, her mate. Hasayon had endeavored to empower himself enough to become the eternal vanguard of the Taharik without accounting for how it might affect himself, or the rest of the region. Such forward-thinking was apparently a known weakness of his.
*Ahma* is a legend passed down in some tihfur clans. The circumstances of its appearance are disputed and widely regarded as impossible by the kin; the recipe for such a calamity requires immense amounts of imbalanced ether and control over one’s Haya, the bestial spirit. Hasayon was a talented individual, the Taharik is a region rich in ether, and the binding ritual Zeepurah and her mate had engaged in to share their power as leaders of the clan had given way to a perfect recipe for bringing about the dreaded beast.
The ritual you performed split the binding further between Zeepurah, Hasayon, and the Taharik itself. Zeepurah believes she can use her newly formed connection to the forest to cleanse the taint and bring things back under control. She leaves Silky with a request to return to the forest periodically to ensure the region does not become gripped in chaos ever again. 
He agreed easily. “I would be remiss as a farseer to turn a blind eye, believing our work complete. Pests love to multiply beneath unwatched stones, after all.”
