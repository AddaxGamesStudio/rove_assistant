Disturb Their Balance
Piercing squeals emanate from the leviathan, rattling your bodies as easily as the leaves falling from above. Slowly, but surely, the labored motions and sounds coming from the beast reach their crescendo and finally come to a halt altogether. The bubble of quiet is burst by a rolling howl. Grandpaw!
Silky twirls his way back down into the pit with the merchants in tow. Mo dismounts from the arkenyn and immediately sets about examining and collecting scattered chunks of ezmenite. Makaal simply collapses face-first into the fur on Grandpaw’s back and groans a muffled cry of relief. He lifts his head up just enough to speak. “I spend more time worrying about our potential demise than any one man should. After the mountain itself took flight I didn’t know if we were going to be able to catch back up! Some of the clan even tried to pin us down, but they gave up the chase after a while. Haven’t seen nor heard anything since you crashed back down.”
Mo waves a tendril casually, still absorbed in their examination of the svaraka’s carapace. “Possible that they’re deceased. The ether from the Sovereign was… well, I believe only she could sustain it. With her gone, they’ll succumb to psychological break if they haven’t already.”
Makaal gawks at the starling. Silky simply tilts his head in thought. Mo continues to speak. “Regardless, the corpse is going to seep off its own ether for quite some time. This forest has been subjected to quite the series of events, no?”
