In the Walls of Henzya
With each creature defeated amidst its halls, the Bonespire quivers and groans. Gargaki, Ozendyn’s glowing companion, was more vicious in its post-slaughter monster-consumption here than ever before. Desperation rose in the screams of the broken vessels swirling around the outside of the tower. Only the glowing of Silky’s aerios and Gargaki provided any sort of solace from the pulsing waves of incorrigible woe.
The tower itself seemed like a strange monument to a time that had long-passed, so what purpose did maintaining it at all serve? Especially as so little of it seemed connected to the state of the rest of the region. Perhaps not surprisingly, even its architecture seemed mismatched, both inside and out. Whatever the Bonespire had once been, its former glory had been fully bathed in a tide of gore and discontent.
With one last push up the half-rib-half-stairs, your group breaks free of the confines of its walls to an amphitheater upon its peak. At its center stood a massive starling with an amorphous form split between upright and bestial. Its bottom four legs were that of a hooved ungulate, the bulk of its lower half a sheaf of chitin, its upper body somewhat human, but long muscular arms and a coiling tail like that of a rasska. Countless blinking eyes winked in and out of its skin. Bone spines erupted from nearly the entirety of its figure. 
It reached one clawed arm forward with a semi-bow. “Bazhar. Father of Navel. Butcher of Henzya.”
