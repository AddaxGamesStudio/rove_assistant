Evil Is A Consequence Of Good
Blind. Deaf. Senseless. For just a moment, the entire world is nothing but a flowing curtain of pitch. Then the hissing and rattling begin. Faster. Louder. Everything you know is engulfed by a whirlwind of inky black.
You retreat from the battle to discover that an oceanic swarm of nektari have descended upon the swamp. Uncountable myriads of the entoman cover everything that you can see. They flutter and buzz and hiss and bite and sting and slurp and plunge the world into a frenzy of endless consumption. 
Broken Vessels stream forth from the dark edges of the forest, involuntarily drawn in by the outrageous concentration of Morph ether. The nascent starling monstrosities throw themselves at the swarms of nektari, only to be swept away in the storm of colorless wings. Their unintelligible screaming can only barely be heard over the fevered buzzing and hissing of the feasting pests.
Suddenly, an odd gushing noise resounds from within the chaos. Then squelching. Plopping. Splattering. The swarm of nektari are literally exploding, one by one, through gorging themselves. Plants, corpses, even some of the cesspools are desiccated by the ravenous entoman, which then proceed to burst into a moist cloud of Morph ether. It’s a gruesome scene to watch play out. 
Their numbers dwindle as they continue to overfeed and pop. While the sky and swamp haven’t yet taken on their natural hues, the cloying miasma is abating very rapidly. You’re just thankful the hysteria is finally over.
