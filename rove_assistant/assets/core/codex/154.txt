Smothered Flame
Bruise-colored clouds rush across the sky, lightning dashing down all around you as the storm above whips to a frenzy. The Firecaller finally breathes her last, that wicked grin still stretched across her face in death. The other Star Hunters are clustered around the fallen crown, shouting and whooping in a crazed celebration as they harvest the immense ether contained in the aspect. 
Mo looks on, their tendrils unusually still and their mouth agape in horror. Makaal takes their shoulder and guides Mo over to Grandpaw, urging the group to leave, now. “There’s nothing more we can do; save this fight for another day, we have more pressing issues to attend to.” 
Grandpaw presses his head against Mo’s side, their tendrils curling through his fur. The comfort seems to break their reverie, “Makaal’s right. The Crux emanating from the crown is steeped in grief, I shudder to think what effect it is having on Uzem.”
The Seat of Storms shakes beneath your feet as the place’s lord demonstrates his rage and pain with an explosion of lightning down in his inner sanctum. Silky’s aerios dives into the hollow with the speed of a streak. “Good work with the Firecaller, Rovers, but I’m afraid rest remains out of reach for you just yet. We must reach the inner sanctum, post-haste! The King of Storms has awoken and is going to grant us an audience, with consequences for all of Lalos if we are late!”
