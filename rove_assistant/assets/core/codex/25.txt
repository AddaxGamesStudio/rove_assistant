Midst Of Black Waters
As the last bit of the giant silvan’s trunk is splintered and obliterated, Hokmala turns to face the dark stream and unleashes a torrent of black bile back into it. A swarm of pale nektari erupt from his fronds and take flight, crossing far to the other side of the stream. It takes one step forward into the churning ichor, the tainted fluid saturating its leg. Another leg, another foul splatter of liquid across a root-like paw and into the massive wounds in its trunk. 
Whatever properties the stream now contains, they don’t seem to be beneficial to the creature. It struggles to move any further and finally succumbs to its wounds. It falls over completely, its body creating a makeshift bridge across the black water. Zeepurah takes a deep breath before moving to a nearby tree and biting down on her finger. When she pulls it away from her mouth, a glowing substance mixed with her blood comes with it. She shifts the finger into a talon, which she uses to carve a glowing mural into the tree’s trunk.
Mo rushes over to the fallen grovetender, thrusting a wooden plate into one of the larger wounds, careful to avoid the dark fluids that splash out. Zeepurah squints at the scene playing out, but says nothing. A bright green flash erupts from the cleaved trunk that the plate was nestled in, and many of Hokmala’s flowers and vines recede into its body. With the effort of many tendrils along with their claws, Mo wrenches out a shield coated in writhing vines—those of a grovetender’s. 
“Hokmala’s death can be dignified like this. This shield shall carry forward as a memory of the forest.” Mo explains. Zeepurah’s eyes widen before she nods in acceptance.
With the memorial complete, you all cross Hokmala’s body into the inky blackness that stretches across the other side of the polluted river.
