A Midnight Dreary
Silky allows his glide to become more of a controlled dive. It has only been a couple of nights since the Rovers contended with the Ahma and were victorious, but time is no longer on their side. The aerios angles itself to descend straight into the valley where his entourage has taken up camp. It is far enough away from the Taharik to be unaffected by the initial spread of Morph and is home to a stream that feeds into the lake further west. In any other situation it would be the perfect place to recuperate over a few more days.
Unfortunately, Silky’s descent was less graceful than intended. He crashes headlong into Grandpaw, eliciting a stunned outcry from the arkenyn which rouses the rest of the camp. A bounce and spiral let the conjuration right itself, where he clears his throat loudly. “Apologies! We now find ourselves in a rush. There’s movement out of the Thunder Mesa towards the north—it is assuredly the Star Hunter clan.”
Makaal’s expression turns stricken, and Mo’s tendrils begin to undulate rapidly. The aerios simply nods. “Our paths are bound to cross with us similarly north-bound. This isn’t how I expected this part of our journey to develop, but if we don’t respond quickly then I fear the worst. We must be off before sunrise!” he exclaims, then launches skyward once more.
The merchant pair exchange looks, turn to regard each of you silently, and begin to pack away the camp without another word.
