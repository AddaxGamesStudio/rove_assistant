In a Mad Expostulation
**“N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O  N O!”**
Each step taken in the churning muck feels like trudging through molten metal. The air thickened with a toxic, cloying bitterness. The swamp is now enveloped in an otherworldly pall, a black shroud that is only woe and rancor. The miasma creeps ever outward, a silent, insidious force, leaving a swath of ruin in its wake as it swallows everything in its suffocating embrace.
**“M Y  L O V E  M Y  L O V E  M Y  L O V E,**
**I  C A N N O T  B E,**
**T H E  L O N E  W I N D E R  O F  T H I S  W O R L D!”**
The abomination shrieks and draws the miasma into its own body. Spines of bone erupt from its flesh. Feathers burst forth from every surface along its hide. Its beak splits apart and a wave of ichor spills forth from its gagging innards.
Time is running out.
