Knock On Wood
Upon entering the nest-home, the darkness and silence surrounding you is broken by the sound of talons trembling against the floor. Huddled in the corner is a young boy draped in a dark feather cloak. He stiffens at your approaching footsteps. As another distant cry further in the village pierces the solitude, he leaps out with his talons drawn. Before fully closing the distance, he realizes you’re not here to hurt him and stumbles across the floor, falling to his knees with a quiet sob.
While helping the boy from his home he mentions how he alone stalked a terranape through the forest, waiting for an opportunity to steal a bloom from the beast. He proudly explains that he escaped the vise-grip of the beast by snapping off one of his own finger bones to slip from its grasp. If he was so brave then, why was that courage so far from his reach now?—such was the child’s lament.
After a brief search of the boy’s home tree, a lockbox is spotted within a hollow. A few practiced lunges up the side of the tree and a quick twist of the box’s clasp reveals its hidden bounty. Found within is a pristine terranape mallow, and a claw still pulsing with Morphic energy—just as the boy had described.
