If Only One Hides It
Many of our records of the more esoteric creatures of Lalos come from starlings as they find themselves with experiences in the most varied of environments. A haunt is one such creature. Small, agile therans with a set of dextrous limbs and odd pouches throughout their hide in which they store… well, just about anything they care to. Apparently the creatures have a keen sense for ether and will “haunt” starlings hoping to acquire their potent cores and other treasures.
It’s unknown what the therans do with their findings as they’re quite adept at escaping observation. Their natural affinity for Crux gives them similar abilities that many young zusag learn to harness–that of creating a natural sort of camouflage. Your best bet for encountering these little miscreants is visiting the sites of destroyed or emigrated clans; they seem fond of the keepsakes left behind. Atop this desolate mycological formation they seem most interested in the gleam of the onisski’s mushrooms.
