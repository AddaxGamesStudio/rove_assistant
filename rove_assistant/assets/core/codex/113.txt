The Stars Never Rise
**“GIVE ME YOUR SONG”**
With each passing moment she grows more and more monstrous. Her wings shedding rafts of feathers, her talons spiraling around her fingers, the muscles in her body pushing out more and more against her flesh. Whatever is happening, there’s no doubt it must be excruciating.
She looks up at you and tries to gurgle out a few words. “Stop…” is the only intelligible word you can make out. She eventually turns to limp away, but collapses forward as she reaches the edge of the moat of swirling Morph. Loud hissing and snapping is accompanied by her shrieks. Suddenly she’s cut off as a swarm of broken vessels descend upon her, pushing her fully beneath the effluvial churn.
Moments later, the trees buckle in the wake of a world-shaking roar. More of the broken vessels thrust themselves in and out of the sickly pools of contaminated ether. Miasma streams between the trees and coats the ground of the emptying village.
You can see the Yanshif screaming and sobbing, but the only sound echoing through the forest is an unceasing, elegiac howl.
