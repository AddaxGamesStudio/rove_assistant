Ornamental Fruits
Azoth are unique among all clades of living being. It is exceedingly rare for something living to be composed of both aspects of Anima in equal measure. Even with the successful fusion of the two energies within the silvan in question it seems… “volatile” at best. It sheds the semi-sentient zokolat fruits regularly which behave as a kind of defense. It’s believed that one out of every thousand of them carries the necessary properties to produce a new azoth sapling.
It’s theorized that this isn’t the only form of “reproduction” for the azoth, but regardless, even a ‘lesser’ zokolat is quite formidable as a lone entity. Their ether formulations are unique and quite valuable, to say nothing of the fact that they are fruit which will fight anything that draws near their “tree”. They don’t seem to survive long without access to Anima, and they putrefy quickly, leaving behind only a muddied puddle of that strange ether.
