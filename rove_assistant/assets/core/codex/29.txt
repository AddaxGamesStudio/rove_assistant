Nevermore
Dawn claws its way through the grove, chasing away the torpor that had fallen over the swamp. Beasts and bugs can be heard calling out to the sun as though it were any other sunrise. As if they hadn’t spent the night listening to Hasayon’s sorrowful wails and choked-out apologies.
The runes painted over Hasayon’s reduced and disfigured body ceased glowing when whatever treatment Zeepurah imparted had run its course. Unable to fully restore him to his natural state but having helped bring him closer to the original balance. Left behind from the process is the molted husk of the Ahma—a parody of the creature that Hasayon once was, composed out of feather and bone, held together by tears and blood. Mo has collected the refuse, muttering excitedly about its “residual potency”.
Zeepurah briefly explains about the process. “Our union was more than love or duty, Rovers; it was a binding wrought in the Morph. Essences inextricably joined. When Hasayon began to fall, so too did I. His transformation broke the union. We both suffered for it, and that accelerated his descent into madness. We are indebted to you for helping to reunite us before I suffered the same fate and we both destroyed the Taharik entirely.”
Guilt is but one of the many emotions still plaguing Hasayon as he weakly tries to sing. Zeepurah handles him tenderly, doing her best to smooth his feathers and keep him steady. She has assured everyone that this was the best possible outcome. There is nothing more but for them and their clan to rebuild and convalesce.
