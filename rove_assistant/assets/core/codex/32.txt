Crystalline Depression
While the main passages of the cave are illuminated by the glowing mushrooms and blazing wrathbone, tucked away at the other ends of the compact and winding corridors everything instead seems to be cast in a violent haze of pinks, purples, and blues. Myriad chunks of what seems to be the same crystals that emblazon the armor and weapons of the keb rasska army are littered throughout the deeper arteries of the cave system.
Kelo and Saras wave you off when prompted about them. Apparently the crystals quickly lose potency when not harvested from the live entomans that produce them. As they are now the crystals are merely just the usual, perhaps slightly more valuable, lyst. Both of the siblings are more than happy for you to keep it for Mo and Makaal as their own crafters have no use for the material.
