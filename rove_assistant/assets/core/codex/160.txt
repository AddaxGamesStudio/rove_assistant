Wait, Where Is Mo?
With a gasp your foe falls, ether expended and limbs failing. The last of their beasts screech and flee. Before you can even let out the breath you’ve been holding, you hear it. A faint cry, “Rovers…”
There in huddle beside a mound of fur lies Makaal, one hand pressed to his bloody leg. Grandpaw whimpers piteously, his snout pressed against Makaal’s side. You rush over to tend to their wounds as Makaal shakily recounts what happened.
That entire bloody battle was a mere distraction. “A few minutes after you went into battle they appeared.” Makaal pauses to cough, his chest wheezing. “Star Hunters, but stealthier than a hintershade, never heard them coming. They got me in the leg, and Grandpaw in his side, and Mo…” He tears up as he describes Mo’s kidnapping.
“I’m sorry Rovers, I won’t be able to properly equip you for a while. Especially not without Mo. Grandpaw won’t be in fighting shape any time soon, but he’s well enough to track. We have to hurry, you know what they do to starlings!”
As the party gets Makaal and Grandpaw cared for and ready to move, one of you goes back to check the battlefield. As expected, a frustrated voice calls out curses in languages you’ve never heard of from beneath the corpse of a fallen beast. You push it aside and free Silky’s embarrassed-looking aerios. He nods to you before you rejoin Grandpaw carefully making his way north after his missing caretaker.
