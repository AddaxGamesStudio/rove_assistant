Not Enough Ether
Harrow have earned their label from starlings with every bit of prejudice they deserve. Instead of using their stolen ether cores to more effectively bend the elements to their whims, they push all of that raw energy directly into their bodies instead. Human bodies are far from malleable; compared to starlings, one might say “entirely unchanging.” Which makes it all the more disturbing how their bodies grow disfigured as they draw the ether into their physiques, more interested in the raw savagery of brute strength.
With unlimited stamina, humans still find themselves lacking in celerity when compared to the beasts of Lalos. Their brutish method of core absorption often emphasizes this particular deficit, so a harrow’s chosen companion often serves as a swifter complement to their prodigious strength. 
All of this has led to the Star Hunter clan using them as vanguards for most operations and hunting excursions, letting the harrow revel in their personal strength, but claiming the spoils for the higher ranked members.
