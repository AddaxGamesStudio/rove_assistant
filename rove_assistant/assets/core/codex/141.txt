A Loss Of Identity
“**ENOUGH**,” each of the bodies scream in tandem. Far more quickly than they had started their assault, each one crumples to the ground in twisted heaps, limbs splayed in impossible configurations. Sickening cracks sound from each body—some going as far as to emit audible shattering. The stolen cores from the broken vessels are all ruined in a single moment. 
Makaal runs a hand over Grandpaw’s snout, ensuring the cloth wrapping is secure around the theran’s sensitive nose. The merchant does his best to not stare at the carnage, keeping his eyes only on Mo and Ozendyn. Momentary glances betray his senses regardless. The starling produces a small parchment and charred stick and is shakily writing notes as Ozendyn and Silky speak to each other.
One of Mo’s tendrils drifts over to Makaal and the starling stops moving entirely for just a moment. A sort of calm washes over their body at the touch—then they turn to join the conversation, motioning toward Grandpaw’s saddlebags and mentioning available supplies.
Mo confers with Makaal on what is on hand and what might need scavenging from… the spoils. Ozendyn has a means to empower his weapon with Crux, but requires a series of reagents that are more esoteric than usual. Makaal grins, finally in his element as the always-prepared traveling merchant. He just hopes he is prepared enough.
It’s hard to say what one truly needs to travel through the domain of something only imagined in the folktales that form the nightmares of children.
