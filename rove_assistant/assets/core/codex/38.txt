Hot And Dreadful
In the chaotic scramble and stress of the explosion-aided escape Mo and Makaal’s most prominent skills appear to be getting themselves into trouble. “Leave it to a starling to come up with a strategem that sees a stash of inert silvan pods erupt with the power to shake a mountain!” Silky squawks, the aerios fleeing much further into the caves. 
“Can’t deny its effectiveness!” Makaal shouts back, a grin spread across his face. Kelo and Saras share a grimace as they pull ahead of your group and lead everyone away from the outpost and into the passages they had marked.
After gaining enough distance from the camp the siblings motion for a reprieve. “This is far enough,” Saras croaks. She pulls out the roughly-sketched map that was acquired from the clan and checks it over. “Just beyond this bend,” she says, motioning for you to follow yet deeper into the cavern.
