Menagerie
*Entry within The Barren Quire from “Earlong”, Scribe of The Wake*
*Are they aware as their bodies undergo transformation? Does ether prompt something inherent to their biology? Or is it something they all hold within themselves and are just waiting for the right materials to call upon?*

Immediately as you crest the stairwell, a piercing screech assaults you. A particularly massive rakifa has turned this chamber into something of a personal domain, and is none too pleased with your intrusion. A small throng of kifa immediately flee through holes in the Bonespire into the outside world.
