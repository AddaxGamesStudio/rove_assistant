What Has Sunk May Rise
Another surge of ether pours from the Bonespire—this one more potent than the last few. It’s enough to grip everyone involved in your fight in a swirl of discomfort and raw torment, even the monsters. All except a lone stomaw gorging itself on a putrid mass of flesh and marrow. Something takes hold within its body and mixes with the ether cast out across the landscape, thrusting it into a sudden transformation. The faint sound of wet tearing permeates from its mound of gristle, followed by an unnerving series of snaps as bones twist unnaturally, lengthening and thickening. The stomaw heaves as though exhaling, and then the transformation begins in earnest. 
From the center of the mass, a skeletal form begins to rise—a colossal creature, its protruding bones cracking and reforming with grotesque precision. Its spine elongates, vertebrae snapping into place like the links of some malevolent chain. Ribcages from a dozen corpses merge into a cavernous, distorted thorax, while femurs and other major bones fuse into towering limbs tipped with jagged claws of pure ivory. At the creature’s head is a yawning, gaping maw of sharp teeth, dripping with bile.
Its movements are slow at first—stiff, mechanical—but as Morph suffuses its form, the creature becomes more fluid, more aware of its grotesque rebirth. Scour. Mo practically falls over after examining the creature with their senses. “Rovers! I want those bones! I promise the weapon will be worth the trouble!”
