The Arena
The small stone chamber is unassuming in its lack of adornment, excluding the thick, plush carpets covering the floor. The Keb Rasska Thought Caser leads you all to the center of the room and helps you to lie down and get comfortable. You feel strangely naked, going into battle without any armor or weapons. The Thought Caser insisted all weapons be left outside, just in case your bodies manage to move while you dream.
A thin, heavily infused string is wrapped around part of each of you, tying you all to the Keb Rasska sitting in the very center of the room. An attendant lights a cloying incense that quickly fills the room and before you can even realize it you find yourself asleep.
Another unsettling feeling, finding one’s self asleep, as your consciousness, so to speak, never wavered for even a moment. In an instant the gray subterranean chamber became an arena of immense proportions. Each pillar, among dozens, holding aloft the skybound roof seems a small mountain. Or perhaps there isn’t even a true roof all the way up there, as the space seems filled with a pale yellow morning light.
A mezzanine floats not far overhead, the oneiric crowd cheering as your names appear written across a hill-sized tournament board. A phalanx of trumpets sounds as the thin mists drifting along the floor start to coalesce into your first wave of opponents.
