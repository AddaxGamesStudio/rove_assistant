This Is Bad
All of the worst thoughts and fears crowd Silkyâ€™s mind as he considers the implications of the power to rend the sky, in the hands of a single person! And a Star Hunter no less. As a proper authority on the history of Lalos, and of Chorus more broadly, given the number of first-hand accounts scattered throughout his library, Silky is uniquely qualified to definitively state the world has only faced such an all-encompassing danger twice before, and those had resulted in the reshaping of entire continents.
But then, was it not in considering exactly such broad-range, unforeseen disasters that Silky had first envisioned this current project, of bringing Rovers together to similarly expand the scope of their abilities? He had hoped to have years to train and test the group before approaching anything of this scale, but such conflict is now unavoidable. At least the Rovers have also advanced far quicker than Silky had even hoped. As intimidating as the Star Hunter problem has become, it would be foolish to discount the Rovers who stared down Addax Uzem in his seat of power!
