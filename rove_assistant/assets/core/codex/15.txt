Borne In Heedless Hum
The viscous fluids of the galeaper queen and her brood mixes with the rain, dripping heavily from your bodies. As the queen exhales her last, the remnants of her swarm scatter as quickly as they can. Without the cohesion of a pod they’ll likely fall prey to something more threatening. No matter where they end up, it’s for the best that they are no longer able to defend a queen bolstering their numbers.
A loud crunch disrupts the still scene—Grandpaw holds aloft one of the queen’s forewings victoriously clutched between his jaws. Curled over the arkenyn’s head is Mo, running their limbs over the carapace of the wing and attaching various small bits of metal and leather to it. “I think this could serve as suitable reward for your efforts, and the beginnings of a proper partnership between us, Rovers. This is quite the opportunity for us both!” they exclaim.
