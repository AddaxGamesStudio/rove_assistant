The Bush Is The Obstacle
As with many therans that have an affinity for Earth, the zinix is host to a unique kind of flora that has grown symbiotically with it. Cladrind is a hearty flower that sprouts from the vines that root in and around the zinix’s shell. When consumed raw, as the zinix is prone to, it confers an immediate boost to endurance. When used as a reagent it allows for the hardening and binding of most material—including flesh and bone.
As you shift your weight along the narrow mountain pass, the shrubbery that had resided on either end suddenly wrenches themselves free from the slopes. Zinix that were comfortably sunbathing—now angered by your assault. Their many long claws find easy purchase on the slopes and crag littered about. Where a precarious boulder might obstruct a regular person, Zinix have no trouble scaling over and around such obstacles.
