We Better Move Quickly
**“Andiron, leave it. We’ve wasted enough time. Let them stew in their fear, we shall deal with them later,”** Eclipse’s orders rumble throughout the ruins of the sunken island. Even from the small hollow you’ve escaped to you can hear the whoops and shouts of the Star Hunters spreading out across the fragment of Era. 
Once the clan seems to have passed Mo explains their plan. “Eclipse wields an immense amount of ether, yes, but it is not his own. He understands the flow ether from an intellectual perspective, but lacks the instinctual understanding of my kind. There exist on Era a number of objects infused with a great amount of ether using a technique practiced only by masters after decades of learning. We call these objects shards, and I believe they hold a power to enable you to contend with Eclipse.”
Silky’s aerios leans forward in interest. “What’s the catch?” Mo nods, “I can’t be sure until I have one in hand, and we’ll need all three I sense on this fallen island for it to work regardless. It isn’t perfect, but it’s the only plan I can think of to let us meet Eclipse at his current level.”
