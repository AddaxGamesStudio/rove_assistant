Quenched Rage
The Embercaller sees her end coming. In a flash her wicked smile turns to a rictus grimace, but just as she is slain she manages to strike one of the ether node’s, cracking it. Her body falls limply onto the stone in death, the starling cores embedded in her torso pressed against it. You see the ether from the cores drift into the node, only for it to immediately leak out of the cracks. The node is ruined, and it will take someone with greater power than even that of your party to free the crown now.
While you all are distracted by the breaking of the node, the remaining Star Hunters quickly siphon what ether they can from the crown before quietly slipping out of the hollow to rejoin their clan. 
Silky’s aerios soon joins you all in the hollow and quickly assesses the swirling flames caging Uzem’s aspect. The construct shakes its head, “There’s nothing we can do for now. The cage will slowly lose power on its own, though I suspect that Uzem’s discomfort will be reflected in his storms for some time. For now, we absolutely must ensure the Star Hunter clan doesn’t continue to make things worse!” 
Makaal examines the ‘cage’ as you prepare to exit the hollow. “So near to home, I can’t but imagine that The King of Storms will find a way to reclaim this power, so long as he survives. I have faith in you, Rovers, that you will show the Star Hunters the error of their ways.”
