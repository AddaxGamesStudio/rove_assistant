Hope Floats
As the stormcaller falls, the crown lets out a deep bellow that brings to mind the sound of a distant, rolling storm. In a blink the creature has launched itself using streams of water, goring clan member after clan member with the force of a raging river. It gallops back to the center of the outcropping and raises its antlers, drawing in the ether from each of the felled Star Hunters as swirling streams of liquid that splash along its antlers.
Once it finishes, it turns to stare at your group, its gleaming eyes boring through you. When it notices Mo, it blasts forth, seemingly intent on collecting every bit of Water ether it can. It takes two of you to halt the wild theran’s charge, but you’re able to do so as Mo stumbles back. After a distressingly still moment, Mo unfurls the tendril that grasps the core they’ve kept close, and holds it before the trembling crown. It sniffs once and instantly seems to lose all interest. It shakes its head once, shedding a large, frozen chunk of its antlers. Then it leaps backwards and turns to stream its way up the outer walls of the shrine along gouts of water.
Mo climbs shakily to a standing position and pulls the extended tendril back to their head. “It’s… there’s nothing there, just ether and intent. His power is far too great and has burned away the mind and body. These crowns were dead the instant the Star Hunters struck their opening blow…” the starling says. 
Makaal sweeps a hand through his hair and turns to look upward. “I hope we have enough rope for this climb.”
