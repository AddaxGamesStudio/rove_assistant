And Shake The Blooms
Silky circles around the terrace within the gargantuan shrine, studying the scene as carefully as his conjuration will allow. “How strange…” he ponders. He returns to floating nearby, reporting on his findings. It seems that the normally aggressive dekaha have become protective of their natural predators. Somehow the silvan entities have become a living screen for the nesting grounds of the galeaper; unusual indeed.
Silky expresses concern and confusion as this is a deeply unnatural arrangement for the creatures in an unaltered habitat. Whether this is the influence of the queen or some other force is unknown, but it does mean that your fight just became much more complicated than it otherwise should be!
