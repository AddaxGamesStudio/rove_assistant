Mineral Shell
Western urns donâ€™t technically have shells, though the crystalline growths upon their backs are often mistaken for them. A minor distinction which only matters to alchemists and the western starling clans who collect them to make into the finest prismatic dyes. After several rounds of burning, boiling, crushing, and ether filtering the crystalline substance turns to a fine powder used to color bolts of cloth a vibrant, shimmering wine-red. While garments of such cloth are prohibitively expensive, they also shine brighter, and more beautifully than the best-made sequins or finest-cut gems.
