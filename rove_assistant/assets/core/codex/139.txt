The Physiology of Fear
The Star Hunter clan was, at one time, just a small scattering of humans separated—or exiled—from their original families. They weren’t known as “Star Hunters” in those days, but the original title has been lost. Their travels led them to take up living in the volcanic reach of the western mountains. A richly fertile land, but home to such hazardous conditions that it was a wonder a clan could find root at all. It required a well-forged body and razor instinct to eke out a semblance of life. Hazardous conditions tend to mean a source of constant or powerful ether, which leads to eventual visitations by starlings.
Nobody has any idea who the first Star Hunter was. The tradition has been passed down from those descended from the volcanic settlers. While many of the clan view starling cores as a way to bolster their command of ether directly, there is another group within the clan that use the cores to empower their physical strength instead. Those farmers and hunters that toil along the sweltering ridges of their homeland relying on the weapons that serve them best: mud and muscle. The companion animals of those original settlers are fierce predators that both defend their territory and hunt what game can be found. A day’s hard work is valued in blood, sweat, and tears.
‘Harrow’ is a label conjured by starlings to describe the unrelenting stamina of these human predators that pursue their chosen prey.
