Exhale
The clearing lies in the aftermath of the intense forces of wielded arcana, the air notably still crackling faintly with the residue of charged Air ether. The crown’s lightning-threaded eyes pan over the scene, landing on the jagged remnants of the ether crystals used to siphon its power. The chunks still pulse faintly, holding fragments of the mixed ether the Star Hunters failed to abscond with. Tilting its head downward, the crown aligns its antlers with the shards. A faint crackle erupts, and the shards flare brilliantly, their energy traveling back as erratic tendrils of electricity.
By the time the last shard has surrendered, the crown stands taller, its body more defined, its antlers now festooned with arcs of steady lightning that leap and twirl along invisible currents. It lets out a sound—a sharp, crackling bellow that echoes through the valley below. With a leap that kicks up a powerful gust of wind, the beast leaps away along the fulgurshrooms back towards The Seat of Storms.
Mo tilts their head slightly, letting their tendrils float gently around their body. “While crowns certainly have some measure of power as addax-spawn, this one was deeply unnatural. It felt like looking directly into a stormcloud, not just ether channeled through a living being. Clearly the Star Hunters have found that just as interesting as I do. Let’s not waste time! I sense another beneath the stalks.”
