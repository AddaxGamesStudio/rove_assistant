Vestigial Fears and Aversions
Bazhar’s core is much smaller than any would expect of a starling so old and prodigious. Ozendyn braves the churning muck to retrieve it. A solid crystal to the touch, yet it bubbles gently, akin to stew on a low simmer. He lifts it to Gargaki to carry in its small tentacles. Then he turns to descend back through the spire, too lost in his own thoughts to do anything more than avoid the muck slowly trickling down the stairwell.
You follow behind in contemplative silence. Each chamber of the Bonespire is a new portrait of the macabre. Dozens of twisted theran and silvan experiments left to decay in strange rooms, slaughtered Star Hunters partially absorbed into walls along the inside of the tower, even some still-twitching bodies of stomaw.
Halfway through your descent, you are briefly deafened by a grotesque crack reverberating through the air. It carries like the splintering of a colossal bone under unimaginable pressure. Ozendyn is the first to react. “The spire! THE SPIRE! WE MUST HURRY!” he shouts, pressing himself against the wall and letting Grandpaw take the lead with the merchant pair secured on their saddles. The scramble to reach the bottom of the tower takes on a new frenzy, resulting in a few slips through the leakage that now seeps from walls rather than just the small stream from above.
Your group spills out into the Unsouled Barrens in a hurried scramble. Bazhar’s tower gives a final immense snap—a sound like the rending of a titanic spine. Its grotesque form buckles inward, segments of flesh and stone shearing apart with wet, visceral popping. A trickle of ichor can still be heard churning through the crumbling ruins, soaking deep into the ground beneath where the Bonespire stood.
Silky’s aerios glides down slowly to inspect the scene, eventually landing on Ozendyn’s shoulder. Ozendyn turns to face the conjuration and a small smile crosses his features. “I feel I owe you a debt,” the human says. With a scoff, the aerios motions a wing at the wreckage of the tower. “Nonsense. If anything, we’ve just provided you with a new sort of headache. I saw the way those young furballs looked up to you. You’ve now got the responsibilities of a new clan leader falling to you, and your first duty will be ensuring nothing escapes these dying lands.”
Before your group strikes northward to pursue the Star Hunter clan, Ozendyn entrusts Mo with the bubbling core harvested from Bazhar. With no more surviving starling members of The Wake, it falls to Mo and Silky to discover its secrets. Now carrying two different starling cores, Mo can’t help but wonder if it is time to finally bring Nu’s core into themself fully. At least then they would be safe from their future opponents.
