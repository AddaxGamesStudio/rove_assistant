Two Down, One To Go
Were your ears physically present they would be set ringing by the raucous cheering of the crowd as you secure your second, and penultimate victory. Whole flowers, their shapes quite impossible in a physical realm, soon blanket the arena’s floor. 
Each of you seems to meet the eye of a particular attendee who tosses you a small favor for you to adorn for the final round. Probably as a result of the Thought Caser’s talent you can each feel the admiration, and desire, of your chosen supporter. The resulting full-body flush you experience must also be a result of the dream’s manipulation, surely. You could never be so easily manipulated by a dream… right?
Your speculation is cut short by the light shifting to a rich brown reminiscent of the most picturesque sunset. This time the mists seem to roil into clouds, the watching crowd quieting in anticipation. Your final challenge approaches; but the Thought Caser adjudicator wordlessly assures you that you should view this as an opportunity to truly display your mettle and ability, as an opportunity for glory, without the dirt and grime of real combat.
