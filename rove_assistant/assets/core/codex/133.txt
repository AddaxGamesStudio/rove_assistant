Guarantee of Dark Morbidities
Nobody is certain when or how the stomaw came to be. Every inch of its bloated, pulsating form is adorned with gnashing teeth and ravenous maws, ever-seeking, ever-hungering. Its birth was not a singular event, but a grotesque process—each mouth sprouting from another, a chain of devouring horrors spawned by the act of consuming flesh. The first whispers of its genesis began with the disappearance of those lost and wandering within the Unsouled Barrens.
As they feed, the Morphic ether they contain reinforces their growth. The mouths multiply, growing and sprawling, an endless cascade of devouring hunger, until it becomes a writhing, slithering mass—no longer a sentient creature, but hunger incarnate. Alive, dead, person, beast, nothing matters but meat to the maw.
