The Crystal And Its Story
The stale air hangs heavy within this recessed chamber of the cavern. After slaying the rest of the wild creatures, it becomes more apparent why they were collected here. Pulsing with a strange energy is a veritable wall of crystals that match the equipment of Kelo and Saras’ clan. With a subdued reverence weighing on their faces the pair approach the gleaming mass. Kelo leaps from Saras and presses his horns against the crystals for a few moments. He turns back with a serious expression.
Suddenly, a sonorous ringing cuts through the tension; Saras has swung one of her daggers at the crystal formation. Both the dagger and the crystals are vibrating in harmony. A grin spreads across her face. “There is a request I have,” she says cryptically.
