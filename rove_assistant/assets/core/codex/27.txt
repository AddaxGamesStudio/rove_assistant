Taste of Morphic Paradise
**“L E A V E  U S  R O V E R S,**
**I  O N L Y  W I S H  T O  S I N G,**
**Y O U  W I L L  N O T  T A K E  M Y  H O M E!”**
Hasayon’s wings go rigid as he launches himself out of the grove and into the blackened trees to the south. You hear his requiem begin again, though much weaker than before. The air hums with his foul energy.
“He retreats to find succor and convalesce; this is a verse he used to sing to me when treating my wounds. It… There is a part of me that believes I can still reach him—the part that remembers these songs. Forgiveness asked, Rovers. I do not think Man and Haya are too far gone for me to bring them back to balance. Let me try and save my beloved.”
It seems Hasayon’s song is more than just for his own peace of body and mind, however. Gray and colorless nektari can be seen fluttering through the blackened trees, back towards his roost.
