Into The Sepulchre
Imposing even in her dying throes, the Yanshif woman refuses to be subdued without one last surprising burst of strength. Her back explodes into a second pair of disfigured wings, her talons separate into heinously curved polydactyl razors, and the feathers along her face fall away in tufts, exposing a twisted visage dripping with Morphic grime. She emits a shrieking keen that leaves you nauseous and dazed. You underestimated this member of the Yanshif—she is much stronger than her kin. The final burst of strength comes at the cost of her remaining life.
The monster attempts to make a dive toward you, completely oblivious to the damage wrought to anything in her way—whether that be the boughs holding the remnants of the village aloft, or her very own limbs. One particularly violent rush results in a partial collision with one of the studier trees, resulting in a leg loudly snapping apart. In an instant she’s sent sprawling, but carries her momentum in a frenzied crawl, relying on the rest of her working limbs. She pulls her entire body along in a blind fury, leading her straight into one of the growing pockets of corrosive Morph. A gurgling shriek is the last thing you hear as her upper torso is eaten away by the particularly destructive collection of ether.
The entire forest falls into a stunned stupor. A few seconds later, roaring erupts through the trees, sending anything even remotely in control of its senses into a flight for its life. The skies grow dark as everything with wings, including the nektari, scatter into the skies. Small fauna scurry underfoot, desperate to find some escape from the aphotic labyrinth that the Taharik has become.
Tears of slick ichor stream down the tihfur faces. Many of them fall to their knees and scream. Others clutch themselves, tear at the dirt, slash at the trees, sob, and fall to whatever personal form of grief is available to their dilapidated psyche.
