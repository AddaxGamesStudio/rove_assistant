Agreement Is The Best Weapon
Sek fighters are known for their strength and endurance above all. Together with the young keb charges they bring to help instill combat experience, a combat unit is formed that serves as the vanguard for many clan settlements. Zisafi, however, are a specialized unit. An agile and furtive rasska paired with a potent Morph-channeling keb that draws attention away from the stealthy attacker. Mix them in with a complement of sek and their effectiveness is that much more pronounced.
Higher ranking officials gain the title of “Principal” and frequently garner positions as commanders and quartermasters. They become responsible for organizing and educating those beneath them in the clan’s wider affairs—the army of the Ezmen is no different. 
By dispatching the quartermaster you gain the key to access whatever cache this particular camp was left in charge of. Clans with keb rasska members often have a streak of paranoia and so the creation of lockboxes is a venerated practice therein. Saras suggests the cache is likely to contain standby weapons set aside when the principal was promoted and gained an ezmenite weapon.
