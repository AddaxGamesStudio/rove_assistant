Gathering Sands
Blessedly, your efforts finally put a merciful end to the hydra’s strained screeches and cries. The other creatures of the beach flee, finally deciding that making a meal of you requires too much effort. As you rest to clean your equipment and recover your stamina Mo wanders over to a patch of the ferrorsands where you had been fighting. They retrieve a small sieve from atop Grandpaw and begin to sift the magnetic sands, saving only the finest grains in a small bottle.
After a few hours of recovery for the party and manual labor for Mo and Makaal, the two return with a flask full of glittering sand. Some of the rejected grains stick to the side of bottle in strange arcing spikes. “With this,” Mo says, swirling the bottle to show the outer spikes shifting and reforming, “I believe we can make quite the unique piece of armor for you Rovers. I wasn’t expecting such a fight, and for that I do apologize, but thank you, friends; it has been too long since I last smelled the salt of the sea mixed with the unique tinge of Zyderos reef.”
