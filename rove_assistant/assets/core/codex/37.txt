Better To Have
Inside of the camp’s stores you find an allowance of lyst, a discarded weapon as Saras predicted, and emergency medical supplies. The lyst is yours now—liberated from the clawed grip of slavers. 
Medical tinctures are a common product crafted and traded by keb rasska alchemists and merchants. As such, poultices and other supplies are a common sight in subterranean enclave clans. The species of keb and rasska are at two ends of a particularly ironic spectrum. Where rasska are full of vitality and able to regenerate most wounds from a near-death state, their robust bodies come at the cost of a metabolism so potent it can shorten their already comparatively short lives. On the other end a keb that keeps out of danger can live for generations, but despite their natural alignment with the power of Morph, their bodies often have extreme difficulty healing through natural means.
