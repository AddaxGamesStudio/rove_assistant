Not-so-Sweet Nektar
An eruption of ichor bursts forth from the hive! Whatever the colorful spores dusting the outside of the hive may have led one to believe, the inside is naught but a solid pod of pitch. The disturbed nektari within are also much paler than their usual cousins. With each flap of their wings flecks of the black syrup are cast about through the air and along the trees.
Rather than the bright and effervescent Arcana-infused nektar that is usually produced in a hive like this, it seems their diet has consisted heavily of Anima-infused essences. The nektar congeals and scabs quickly now that it has been exposed to the open air. It still seems useful as a catalyst regardless of its strange transformation.
