No Salvation Should Come
For a brief moment, a moment barely long enough to catch your breath in, everything in this darkened recess of Lalos is still. The tunnels free of subjugated denizens, the walls sturdy and unchallenged by forays, the soldiers’ blades poised but motionless. Another moment passes—everything seems to erupt at once. 
**SUCCESS**
**TRIUMPH**
**PRIDE**
The walls of the chamber rumble and quake. Silky haphazardly retreats from his perch in a disgraceful flailing of wings. “TAKE COVER, THIS IS NO ILLUSION!” he screams. Each of you scramble to an alcove towards where you entered. Grandpaw disappears into the tunnels entirely, dragging a protesting merchant pair with him.
**IT’S HERE I’M HERE IT’S TIME**
The thoughts press unbidden against your mind, indiscernible from an inner voice or shouted celebration. In the next moment everything is unadulterated chaos. The back walls of the chamber explode in a shower of boulders and rubble. Mind-bendingly vast claws wrench the rock apart as if it were nothing more than parchment. Dozens of keb rasska soldiers are crushed, buried, and ripped apart by the gargantuan entity thrashing its way through the rock.
The ezmenite-clad rasska commander stumbles her way over rock and ruin as she reaches a twisted arm up towards the collapsing ceiling. “SISTER, THIS IS—” In a deafening peal of shearing metal and rock, one of the great claws descends upon the rasska woman, obliterating her in an instant.
**AMUSEMENT**
**REVENGE**
**CONTENT**
With the heavy emotional impressions lingering upon your thoughts, the massive crystalline features recede from the chamber. A frozen aperture of massive ezmenite crystals peers back at you as you carefully crawl out from your makeshift shelters. A speck of white chitin rests atop the circle of crystal stalactites—Femii. The entire mountain radiates with the sensation of her emotions.
**SATISFACTION**
