Violation Of The Order Of Nature
Mo was happy to be this far from the fight, but would be happier to be farther still. Regardless, given the concentration of Morph ether within each creature, it wasn’t difficult for the starling merchant to track the progress of battle. The pitiful vessels flitting about wailed in desperation and their tendrils flailed in a fog of motion. What was astonishing was watching what happened when these frantic beings collided.
Starlings exist in a state of permanent transience. Energy is gathered and expended, bodies adjusting with each mote of ether, cores solidifying with more and more facets. This allows for a plethora of esoteric events to occur; one of the most notable is when starlings combine. An event that is both rare and poorly understood. How strange, then, to witness these estranged cast-offs manage the process. Not a pure joining, but a tenuous bond created out of their collective desperation for connection. Something to ponder with Silky at a later time, perhaps. Maybe by then Mo wouldn’t be so distressed from witnessing the perils of the Unsouled Barrens first-hand.
