Its Sullen Sound
The hum and buzz of the writhing entoman swarm abates as each and every one twists to face your group in a flash of movement. While an immature galeaper can be described as “small”, that’s more of a relative attribution, as mature galeaper stand about as tall as an adult human. A single Rover stands good odds against two or three, but even then it’s considered a fraught effort. It’s no small blessing that galeaper don’t swarm in vast numbers once they leave the nest—competition for resources is too fierce for more than a few to claim the same territory at once. They prefer smaller hunting pods for the sake of efficiency.
This particular swarm of immature, zusag-sized galeaper are unfortunately yet to depart their makeshift nest. This is an excellent opportunity… if you don’t stop to consider what it means to be found at a galeaper’s nest to begin with. For now you should focus on the task at hand, but be wary of both what they primarily feed upon—ether-rich silvan flora that have evolved to try and contend against giant entoman creatures such as the galeaper—and what led to their nesting here in the first place.
