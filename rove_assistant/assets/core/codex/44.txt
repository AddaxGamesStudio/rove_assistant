Communicate Something Incommunicable
**FEAR**
**You would condemn Chorus? What gives you the right? You lack the necessary strength. What gives you the right? WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT? WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT?**
Femii’s psychic hysteria continues, seizing everything and everyone still within the mountain. With one final outburst she topples from her seat atop the dying skara—and her head slams against an awkwardly protruding chunk of ezmenite along the creature’s carapace. A puncturing snap heralds a deathly quiet throughout the broodchamber. Heavy silence permeates the caverns as every directly enthralled by Femii shares in her fate.
“Rovers! By my horns, what is— Oh!” exclaims the aerios as it flutters into the chamber. “I was so absorbed in protecting our charges that… my word…” Silky trails off, for once struggling to find words.
After a few moments, Mo and Makaal rush in after Silky and stop just as quickly to take in the sight of destruction before them. Mo shakes their reverie quickly and begins an examination of the chamber and the felled skara, even going as far as to liberate a broken mail of ezmenite from its jaws.
