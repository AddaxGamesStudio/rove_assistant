The Joy Of Young Ideas
Slowly, the energy in the air draws to a still… occasionally punctuated by not-so-distant peals of thunder reverberating throughout the valley. With a flash of wings and irate hissing, the rest of the entoman swarm disperses—retreating back towards where their queen has built her nest. With a tinkling chuckle, Silky’s aerios takes flight after them. “Come now, we shall finish what we started! Let it not be said we were unreasonable guests within this venerated abode.”
While none of you are certain that Uzem would care particularly about your conduct in this place, it’s impossible to deny that the sight of silvan overgrowth and entoman infestation is unusual and likely unappreciated. If Uzem isn’t here to take care of it, it falls entirely within your domain as Rovers to do so instead. For now, you can only continue onwards and upwards along the grooves within the trunk of the Seat of Storms.
