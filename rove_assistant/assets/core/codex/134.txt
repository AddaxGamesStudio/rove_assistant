A Placid Island Of Ignorance
When a nascent starling is found today it is a jubilant affair, but it was once a time for concern and fear. Starlings left on their own, bereft of intelligent guidance, become ineffable reflections of their environments. Beaks, claws, fins, tails, talons, and the ever-present array of tendrils. No two starlings look the same and it’s easy to imagine more primitive people laying eyes upon a glowing amalgam of their natural predators and losing all sense of reason.
Ether is the driving force for starlings before they form a consciousness, but there have been arguments that ether is not the true motivator, and instead that the essence of connection is what is truly being sought. Mimicking their surroundings, drifting between locales, and the common appearance of tendrils that reach unbidden to their surroundings—all of it serves said argument.
Tragic, then, that the incorrigible children of the Unsouled Barrens are half-formed reflections of a prison of destitution and despair.
