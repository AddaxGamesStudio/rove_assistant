We Have Need of Your Knowledge One Last Time
As soon as the immediate threat is dealt with, Mo takes the final shard and mounts Grandpaw. You quickly seek out a defensible little crevice in the destroyed fragment and let Mo and Makaal set to work. Watching the pair work is as mesmerizing as ever, with the use of both mundane and ether-infused tools making quick work of the artifacts. 
After about half an hour of non-stop work Mo tells the party, “The important work of shaping and maintaining the shards’ ether channels is done, but their final shape remains undetermined. As it stands, I can fashion the shards into one of two shapes: an ethereal Catena of almost pure ether, or a stalwart Aegis of true protection. Either will grant you the necessary understanding to manipulate ether at an intrinsic level, like a starling, but you must decide which you would prefer.”
