The Play Is Badly Cast
With a foul braying, the offspring of Uzem falls to its knees, the power forcibly inhabiting its body casting itself back towards the peak of the shrine. After a few moments Grandpaw clatters his way up to the flat upon which you all rest. He carries Mo and Makaal to the fallen corpse of the crown–this one not completely torn apart by the evacuation of Uzem’s power. Mo immediately sets upon the body, wielding a variety of tools.
Silky appears soon after in a flash of wingbeats and cursing. “Good news, bad news, I’ll spare you all the choice of which to hear first. The bad news is Uzem’s state of unrest is due to Star Hunters sinking their claws into places that they shouldn’t. The good news is our path towards the peak of the shrine should be relatively uncontested! And with every turn of fortune is misfortune, for I fear we are not yet finished with these conjurations of the addax.”
