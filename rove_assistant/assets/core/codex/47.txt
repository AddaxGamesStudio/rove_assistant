Still and Solitary
“Fresh air has never before carried such relief!” Makaal exclaims as your party emerges from the depths of the mountain caves. Mo and Silky had kept everybody underground as they performed examinations and experiments upon the ezmenite, with the results of their tests coming up less than satisfactory. Ezmenite is a potent material and, with more time and resources, could contribute to some groundbreaking discoveries. Femii’s psychic abilities were already unprecedented—apparently large quantities of ezmenite could allow for a kind of augmentation to keb with potent psychic manifestation, if they were willing to dedicate years and years of their life to understanding the intricacies of “noetic resonance” and other esoteric properties as described by Silky. As far as the physical properties of the material are concerned its efficacy is already demonstrated but, according to Mo, is difficult to properly temper into equipment without training and specially crafted tools.
Given the apparent difficulty of doing anything more with the material in its current state, it will all have to wait until your mission for Silky is concluded. It is unclear how many clans and settlements the Ezmen Queens consumed or destroyed in their pursuit of their conquest. Any survivors will doubtless begin to spread fear and distrust of any who seek to collect and process ezmenite as a result of the army’s actions, so even if Mo and Makaal had their own designs on expanding their trade, it would almost certainly be met with reproach.
Roving throughout Lalos will allow other dreams, ideally ones less oppressive in nature, to flourish instead. Best to continue forward and let this particular iniquity stay buried.
