Beyond a Certain Point
Relentless. That was the only word that accurately described the combatants. Pushed to the brink until their bodies were literally unable to move—each fighter sprawled out where they were defeated as one might view a toy doll with its strings severed. The battle was eerily uncanny as the people and creatures fighting for the “Sovereign” were completely silent. No outbursts of emotion, no attempt at discourse, just unflinching killing intent.
Mo and Makaal quietly banter as they collect the scattered equipment of the soldiers and harvest small bits of the dead beasts. Grandpaw resists coming closer to the mouth of the cavern at first—perhaps with good reason, as when each of you draws close a certain pressure worms its way around your thoughts. Not enough to unbalance you physically, but perhaps enough tension to stop you for a split second were you to allow your vigilance to wane.
