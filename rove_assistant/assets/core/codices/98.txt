The Suffering World
Zeepurah follows the glowing zusag conjuration until it lands overlooking a great chasm at the edge of the woodlands. She rakes a talon through her left wing. It hasn’t stopped itching since Hasayon had been pulled from the brink, but out here she can only think of plucking her own feathers in an attempt to calm her hide. While not as potent as when her mate had been violently losing control of himself, something in the air here now leaves her with similar uneasy feelings.
“Forgiveness asked,” begins Silky, reminding her with a quick jolt yet again that a zusag had managed to create a speaking puppet from one of their soul-manifestations. The sage speaks at length about their journey through the mountains and how it brought them tumbling back to her forest with quite the audacious show.
Even if this massive creature hadn’t been injured in its altercation with the Rovers (what an impressive predator to bring low!), without the keb queen interfering with its natural course of life, it would have only lived a short life after giving birth to its brood. The immense head of the creature has nothing resembling a mouth to consume nutrients with; instead only hosting some of its sensory organs.
After the sage finishes his lecture, Zeepurah turns her attention to the starling that is carrying a chunk of the crystalline material towards her. The avian-manifestation and starling explain that the very skin of the creature is rife with energy that flows between Morph and Crux. Not like the strange azoth tree that bears both energies actively, but something of a dormant energy waiting to be drawn upon. Their words are meant to give her hope for helping along Hasayon’s recovery, and perhaps even the Taharik in its entirety.
Zeepurah isn’t sure how to thank the zusag and his group of Rovers. She settles on what her clan seems to do best: leave others with a warning. 
The Star Hunters are tracking quarry once more.
