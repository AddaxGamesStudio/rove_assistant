Agony of Desire
**“M Y  L O V E,**
**L E T  U S  S I N G.”**
Piercing shrieks escape the elongating beak of the Yanshif woman. Her form is considerably more monstrous now. Two massive wings envelop a bone-thin frame. Vicious talons extend from her limbs, each the size of her forearms. Eyes wide and rolling about wildly within their sockets, each one streaming with rivulets of foul ichor. Her skin hardens everywhere the substance comes into contact—it petrifies her avian features into a rictus grin. 
She launches herself clear across the marsh with a mighty flap of her wings. The putrid fluids of the swamp splash all over her body. A wild cackle escapes her lips as she thrusts her massive talons downward, using the momentum of her launch to let them tear through the trembling blubber of the weakened briarbull and putting it out of its misery on the spot. Her flight takes her further into the swamp, disappearing into the Morphic haze that obscures the region. 
For all one would hope that slaying a swollen avatar of putrescence and toxicity would mitigate the foulness of the marsh, if anything the death of the briarbull has just made things even more disgusting. Grandpaw categorically refuses to follow you all across the marsh, leaving Mo to harvest the remnants of the dead broodfather by themself as Makaal does his best to comfort his understandably upset companion.
