The Danger Ebbs and Flows
As the blood of the twitching briarbull spills out into the swamp, a wave of Morphic ichor explodes from its stomach, washing out over the marsh. The instant it comes into contact with the Dim nodes on which you transcribed the patterns Mo and Silky devised, the ritual springs to life! Everyone grabs the closest solid object they can as a sudden vortex pulls the entire marsh towards its center.
The first change you notice is that the pall of miasma has lightened considerably. Some amount of peace has cut through the current of filth hanging over the marsh. Said peace is immediately shattered as the Yanshif woman clutches herself and begins to panic. She swings herself around violently before eventually collapsing at the center of the ritual site.
Her shifted features and painful contortions begin to right themselves. The large crystals surge with the dark anima wresting control of her bodily functions. She draws a deep, slow breath, and rises to her feet. The woman’s expression is equal parts awe and horror as she examines herself, followed by your party. 
She unstrings the bow attached to her tattered outfit and tosses it at you. For several moments she works her jaw as she rediscovers her capacity for speech. “This… temporary. Fly swiftly… kill him. He cannot… be free.” Her broken speech leaves her in fits of sputtering and coughing.
In the center of the ritual site she assumes a meditative pose. Her tattoos begin to pulse with energy as she seizes control of some of the ambient ether, drawing more and more of it swirling around and into herself and the crystals she sits between. With enough luck the ether she’s gathering will weaken the source, as Mo suggested.
