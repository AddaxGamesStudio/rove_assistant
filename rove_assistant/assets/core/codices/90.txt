Silky and Mo take up a defensive position behind the felled skara and begin to study it, hoping to glean some sort of advantage for the fights ahead. Right away it’s obvious that the armor and weapons being used by the clan here are harvested and refined from these massive entoman. Silky offers that while knowledge of these creatures isn’t secret, almost no clan other than the one currently trying to kill you has ever concerned themselves with the particulars.
“Ezmen!” he chirps suddenly. “I remember now. This clan was identified as ‘Ezmen’—the carapace of these entoman must be the ezmenite they ply.”
Mo presses a few tendrils around a small chunk removed from the corpse. “It’s… strange. It contains… Morph, but not-Morph? Crux, but not-Crux? It’s Anima for sure… It responds well to my own Morphic energy either way. Perhaps this is what’s giving the Principles such ready control over other beings?”
