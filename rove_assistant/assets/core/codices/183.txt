Kaleido Caldera
After several days of arduous tracking, you’ve finally followed the Kaleido to her temporary burrow. When you come upon her only the top portion of her shell is visible above the waters of the small underground lake. Thankfully you have the opportunity to scope out the room before the fighting begins; she is slowly absorbing the water to refill her stores in her shell, a time-consuming process for an urn so absurdly overgrown as the Kaleido. 
The walls of the cave are covered in natural-forming crystals. Likely your quarry is saving them for a midnight snack, but thankfully in the meantime they provide ample light for the cramped quarters. 
At least, that’s all you see until setting a single foot inside. Immediately the beast senses your intrusion and lifts her bulk from the water to confront you. Water streams down from the massive crystals adorning her shell, each larger than a grown person. Even worse, as the water clears you can see that her shell is actually many layers thick, grown over time and again like a pearl forming its iridescent layers. You’ll have to carefully chip away at the covering before you stand any chance of damaging the beast.
The Tihfur are known for saying, “Harms come in threes,” which is proved true once again as massive, slimy tentacles emerge from small holes in the floor of the cavern. The Kaleido has truly infested the entire cave. This is the urn’s territory now, and you’ll have to take it from her inch by inch.
