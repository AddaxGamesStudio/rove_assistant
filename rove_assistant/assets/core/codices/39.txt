Ready To Release
One should think that flowers and vines, by and large, would be one of the less threatening inhabitants of Chorus. Unfortunately this is false, and quite dangerous to believe. Silvans on average may be even fiercer than therans. Certainly not to be trifled with unless you know what you are dealing with.
Tihfur were (and still are) usually the first to categorize the more dangerous plants one encounters across the lands, thus many derive their labels from tihfur convention. Ashemak were among the most feared for their sheer intensityâ€”a silvan that had somehow adopted an affinity for Fire. It uses flame to ignite their seeds and launch them at speeds faster than any amount of eyes can hope to track. It will puncture through rock just as easily as flesh, taking root wherever the seeds find themselves embedded. 
For this reason it has spread far and wide, and the hazardous ashemak eventually found itself being used as a form of natural defense by more enterprising clans throughout Lalos.
