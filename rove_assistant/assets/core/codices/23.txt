Marsh Mallow
*Notes from Tuor’s bestiary—*
Terranapes are strange beasts by all accounts. Massive, territorial, and… selectively clever? They know well enough how to use their strength to control the nesting grounds. Some even tie vines to trees as makeshift traps! However, they never seem willing to allow more than a few others of their species into claimed territory. Young pups are sent into the wilderness after they’re strong enough to hunt for their own food. Should they return after that time they are met with the same rancor held for any other perceived invader. Or held for their own siblings or mates. Or for random rocks and trees. They’re an outrageously dangerous and volatile presence if they take root anywhere near a clan’s home.
Something unique to the terranape is their incredibly potent healing. It seems their bodies are host to a special kind of plant that feeds on their elemental affinities and provides heightened recovery in return. Those brave enough to try and rend these from the bodies of the felled (or still-living for the truly fearless) will find themselves with an amazing reagent for recovery.
