It Must Catch Fire
Chorus’ underground is no less vibrant, nor more safe, than its surface. Evolutionary competition fueled by magic is just as fierce. An easy example is the wrathbone, named by humans who live on the borders of caves, which wields its affinity for Fire in a surprising show of ingenuity.
While naturally blind, these large reptiles are profoundly sensitive to temperature, and use that sensitivity as a sense nearly as effective as the sight they lack. In the depths of caves and other poorly lit regions it makes sense for a creature to evolve a more sophisticated means of navigation. They seek their prey with gouts of flame and smaller embers cast from and along their bodies. They attack their targets with blistering heat and knife-like spines—the natural weapons from where their name was drawn—then greedily feast on the pre-cooked remains.
