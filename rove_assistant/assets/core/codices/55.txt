Slithering Malice
Dyad have well-earned their reputations. Twin heads–each full of malice and hunger–with twin rows of fangs that span from snout to stomach. These clever creatures use their crests and Crux to captivate prey, before snapping forward to unleash their deadly venom. They make their homes just about anywhere warm without incident; other beasts prefer to find new dwellings rather than challenge a dyad. Handling dyads requires intense focus and care as one wrong move, or even just catching that strange bit of swaying movement from the corner of your eye, can spell disaster.
The giant silvan was likely viewed as a safe place for an injured mother to leave her hatchlings, relying on the shared properties of Anima to hide amongst the zokolati fruits which would otherwise make a meal of the young creatures. Given more time to mature, they’ll likely spread and begin to hunt the stomaw for food and territory, adding to the turmoil across the landscape.
